  abstract = {This paper offers a critical review of scholarly research on fixers, the local collaborators of foreign correspondents, in conflict reporting. Based on a thematic analysis of work that addresses news fixing, we summarize what we know about fixers in conflict zones while using postcolonial lens to further develop some critical arguments that are already present in the body of research. Existing studies well describe what fixers do, who they are, and the inequalities in safety, in authority over the content of reporting, and in the distribution of money that haunt conflict reporting. However, we argue that most of the research too readily accepts as a starting point the division between West and non-West, which assumes that fixers are fundamentally different from and unequal to Western correspondents and emphasizes these disparate identities without questioning them, thus reproducing fixers’ otherness and exoticism. To gain a better position for promoting creative justice, we suggest that future research practices and questions could be recalibrated in line with the postcolonial move and the current reconfiguration of the political and epistemic relations between the world’s regions. },

We provide an overview of Miller’s life and examine the IPA’s efforts including publications, community programs, and an anti-racism curriculum, all meant to improve critical thinking skills in individuals and help democracy. We highlight the parallels between the political and media environments of the 1930s and the current proliferation of online mis/disinformation, and bring to light archival material about his dismissal from Columbia University. },

Using a feminist lens to critique the leaky pipeline metaphor, I discuss how this metaphor assists in a collective amnesia that allows game studies to ignore the larger culture problems associated with games and the industry that makes them. In its place, I offer up Neil deGrasse Tyson’s use of “blood on the tracks” to describe how some people are actively pushed out of our field. As a way forward, I suggest that by reimagining how we teach game studies’ genesis point, it will offer up the potential for a brighter, more diverse future for our field. },

As such, it can be, and should be, celebrated as one of the journals that laid the foundation for the contemporary proliferation of communication studies work that critically examines topics that disproportionately effect marginalized people. Still, what I argue is this journal is something more: in terms of journals with an explicit communication studies focus, this journal remains the main journal of Black studies for communication scholars, which is to say it is a material break from the dominant, White communication studies discipline completely. In many ways, then, the journal is not necessarily a communication studies journal, despite its name, but a Black studies journal for us scholars trained in communication studies. },

  abstract = {What does Media Studies study? Recent contributions to the field have made the compelling case that everything that communicates meaning—texts, bodies, networks, environments, the world itself—is media, declaring the field’s status as the discipline of all disciplines. But media is also something historically and linguistically specific: the concept didn’t even enter common usage until the late 1950s. This dissertation examines the specificity ofmedia’s semantic forms—mass media, the media, mediums, mainstream media, and media studies—each ofwhich serves as the inspiration for one ofits chapters. But I am no less invested in the word’s vagaries and (sometimes obscurantist) capacity: what forms ofpolitical critique and ideological mystification does media afford? Just as each chapter is defined by an iteration ofthe media concept, so too is it focused on a  specific social formation—the intelligencia, the market, the art world, the industry—that has appropriated the media concept to reinforce its own boundaries and influence. Chapter One recovers the already dense meaning of “mass media” from a 1959 conference, hosted by the Tamiment Institute, titled “Mass Media and Mass Culture,” featuring Hannah Arendt, James Baldwin, Randall Jarrell, and the President ofCBS Frank Stanton, among other intellectuals and industry titans. For the conference’s illustrious speakers, “mass media” was variously a boon to civic participation, a scourge inviting corporate monoculture or totalitarian social control, and a clever euphemism for commercialism. Zooming out from the high-level circumlocution ofthe Tamiment conference, I trace the term’s multiplying meanings (and related terms) in the New Yorker, Time, Newsweek, Vogue, Ebony, Jet, ArtNews, and the Partisan Review between 1950 and 2000—a corpus ofmagazines that I built and analyzed using word-embedding models, with support from Yale’s Digital Humanities Lab. The results ofthis data collection and processing lead me to the questions that motivate each ofthe dissertation’s subsequent chapters. In Chapter Two, I question the historical significance ofpersonifying media (i.e. the media) for midcentury black intellectuals—even as communication theorists like Paul F. Lazarsfeld and Robert K. Merton were dispelling the notion of a singular, centralized media as a myth perpetuated by Cold War paranoiacs. Beginning with Harold Cruse’s call to Black intellectuals to “revolutionize the cultural apparatus” and “neutralize CBS, NBC, and ABC, ” I use archival and textual analysis to reexamine the complex relationship between Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison—often seen as ideological and stylistic opponents—in terms oftheir different political and rhetorical strategies for confronting, revolutionizing, and neutralizing “the media,” singular and hegemonically white. Chapter Three moves from the Black press and publishing to art criticism and museums. I demonstrate that in the very decades that the “media concept” entered the vernacular, the “medium concept” began to shape art criticism, art history, and museum studies. It became standard practice, for example, for wall labels and catalog captions to display the medium, or material, of the work of art; and art historians and connoisseurs began to use the un-Latinate plural “mediums” to rhetorically elevate and distinguish the category of art from the imperial spread of mass “media.” This was no coincidence: mediums emerged as a category for the organization and appreciation of art as thedialectical counterpart to media, and in response to the cultural imperialism ofits mass- produced forms. I analyze the cultural criticism ofClement Greenberg, Michael Fried, and Rosalind Krauss, alongside the exhibition archives ofthe Museum ofModem Art. I then turn to the earliest theorists and purveyors of “camp” culture—Parker Tyler, Charles Henri Ford, Gore Vidal—to demonstrate that the camp sensibility worked through the mediums/media dialectic toward a self-critique ofboth high and low art forms. Chapter Four turns to the institutional history ofAmerican electricity companies, film studios, and broadcast networks, which in the 1970s and ‘80s stopped being called agents of “mass media” and were rechristened as tributaries ofthe media’s “mainstream.” In this age of conglomeration, these industries pivoted from competing for “mass audiences” to functioning as collaborators or subsidiaries, and presented the “media personality” as their friendly face. A study of eponymous TV shows ofthis era (from the Nat King Cole Show to the Mary Tyler Moore Show), reveals that, unlike “mass media,” agents of “mainstream media” could absorb alternative media into their flow of programming and capital. Mobilizing the logic ofthe “personality,” they even made racial and gender difference the face oftheir increasingly consolidated production. In each ofthese chapters, “media” bolsters a secondary concept that it also threatens to obsolesce: culture, democracy, art, diversity. So, too, with the humanities— as Media Studies offers itself anew as a macro-disciplinary means ofunderstanding our world.},

  abstract = {Minds then Hearts examines the U.S. military’s resistance and hostility towards psychological warfare and examines how this affected the weapon’s use during the Korean War. The conventional military rejected psychological warfare as “paper bullets” that had no place in a military focused on lethal means – blast, heat, and fragmentation, to defeat its enemies. In particular this study will examine how the inability to demonstrate conclusively the effects of psychological warfare operations added to uncertainty and skepticism over the weapon’s potential and actual impact on the battlefield. Additionally, the study explores how operational deficiencies such as a lack of resources and poor integration with combat arms created obstacles hampering the successful employment of psychological warfare against Chinese and North Korean forces. The study will also compare the Army’s efforts to use the weapon with those of the Air Force that, at times, considered strategic bombing as synonymous with psychological warfare. Further, the Chinese and Russian use of atrocity propaganda, especially the forced confessions of waging biological warfare by American prisoners, will be examined in order to demonstrate how these efforts impacted on the American
military’s view of their own psychological warfare campaigns. The study acknowledges and describes the difficulties involved in evaluating the effectiveness of psychological warfare operations in general and during the Korean War. Minds then Hearts concludes that the most important obstacle to effective psywar operations was the failure of Army officers in the field to understand the potential of psychological warfare and thus, fail to integrate it properly into their combat operations. Many combat commanders saw psywar solely as an instrument designed simply to induce surrender. Psywar personnel, eager to demonstrate their worth did little to dispel this limited view. The inability of the psywar proponents to consistently provide demonstrable and tangible indicators of success meant that when forced to choose between leaflets, loudspeakers and firepower, operational leaders chose firepower. The result was that psywar proved successful only in a limited tactical sense but never created the type of operational or strategic victories sought by the weapon’s proponents.},

@article{Simonson2022Exclusions,
  abstract = {In this introduction for the special section on “Exclusions in the History of Media Studies,” we begin by calling attention to the constituting role that exclusion has played in the historiography of media studies. Exclusions linked to gender, race, language, colonialism, geopolitical location, and institutionally sanctioned privilege play substantial roles in shaping formal and informal accounts of our fields’ pasts. The project of reversal and recovery builds on postcolonial and decolonial thought, Afrocentric and racial critiques, feminist scholarship, and geopolitically informed critique. One aim is to provincialize much of the historiography of media studies. Drawing inspiration from the deeply inter-animating contemporary critical movements, we identify four pressing tasks for the history of media studies: 1) to throw the present state of academic fields into sharper historical relief, 2) to build international collaborations that refigure what have been taken to be the “centers” and “peripheries” in media studies, 3) to find ways to resist the growing hegemony of English in the global knowledge system, and 4) to support an open and nonprofit publishing infrastructure. We propose that a historiography informed by constitutive and contingent understandings of exclusion represents an important way forward for the history of media studies.},

@article{Loblich2022West,
  abstract = {This paper examines how the West Berlin communication studies department, for over 40 years, was tied to or “disciplined” by the Cold War, leading to practices of exclusion and hegemony. Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s concept of symbolic power, we analyze how anticommunism as a discourse formed the habitus, capital, and field logic of West Berlin communication studies. Sources are archival material from Freie Universität Berlin (Free University of Berlin), minutes of Abgeordnetenhaus von Berlin (parliament), press from East and West Germany, and autobiographical material and academic publications from West Berlin and West German communication scholars. The paper describes how the anticommunist discourse at first helped Emil Dovifat, professor and department director from 1928 on, to protect himself from attacks regarding his Nazi past and to reestablish his reputation after 1945. For his successor, the interim director Fritz Eberhard, the anticommunist discourse caused problems. Eberhard tried to consolidate the poorly reputed discipline at Freie Universität Berlin during the 1960s; however, this effort was weakened because he had to defend himself against press attacks for being a socialist. Finally, the unique geopolitics of West Berlin, together with the anticommunist discourse, help to explain why the West Berlin department developed after 1968 into a (lonely) center of critical theory indebted to Marx and the Frankfurt School, and how these approaches were marginalized by the rest of the field and by the political system in the 1970s and 1980s.},

@article{Mance2022Inequality,
  abstract = {Our study focuses on the prevalence of conceptualizations of communicative inequality in the field of communication studies after the end of World War II. While communication studies has adopted and been influenced by conceptualizations of inequality from related disciplines and fields, conceptualizations of communicative inequality seem to have played only a marginal role. By means of a network analysis conducted on a corpus of more than fifteen thousand articles published in eight prominent international journals in the field between 1945 and 2018, this study aims to map the prominence and adoption of different conceptualizations of communication inequality. With the tools of network analysis, the study identifies particular conceptualizations by tracing the most co-occuring cited authors associated with a particular conceptualization across time. We identify four distinct clusters of conceptualizations: modernization theory, cultural imperialism, knowledge gap, and digital divide. Historically, approaches to communication inequality have been divided either along ideological lines—largely defined by support for (modernization theory) or opposition to (cultural imperialism) US foreign policy—or in terms of different levels of communication inequality. While both modernization and cultural imperialism focus on international communication inequality, the knowledge gap tradition focuses on interpersonal differences. We argue that the dominant approaches and paradigmatic shifts in conceptualizations of communication inequality have largely been driven by forces outside of communication studies. Modernization, which dominated the period until the late 1970s, grew from US interests in securing hegemony in the third world. Critiques of cultural imperialism emerged during the 1970s as a direct challenge to modernization theory, connected strongly to third-world opposition to US hegemony. The notion of a digital divide, which has become the predominant conceptualization of communication inequality since 2000, stems largely from the concerns of the US Commerce Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration for providing “universal service” to US citizens, while the knowledge gap tradition relates to the effectiveness of top-down communication campaigns.},

Seguir la trayectoria académica e institucional de Pasquali entre 1979 y 1989, dada su conexión con espacios múltiples de organización cultural e investigación comunicacional, permitirá analizar las tensiones que atravesaron el proceso de institucionalización de los estudios de comunicación latinoamericanos a lo largo de los años ochenta del siglo XX.},

@article{Wu2022Journalism,
  abstract = {In China’s reform era (1979–), to revitalize the newspaper for economic modernization, journalism scholars turned to American mass communication study after Wilbur Schramm’s visit in 1982. This familiar story of the birth of the Chinese communication discipline misses a critical thread. Faced with constant political contractions, systems cybernetics crept in: The supposed founder of communication, Wilbur Schramm, spoke in Claude Shannon’s name; China’s “King of Rocketry,” Qian Xuesen, pledged to augment Norbert Wiener; and Engels’s writing on dialectical materialism was seized upon as part of official Marxism. 1980s China is known for the revival of humanism. However, in the tightly controlled news sector, reformist scholars conjoined systems cybernetics and Engels’s Marxist philosophy, dismantling the human subject in the process. This articulation of the epistemology and ethic of newsmaking, which has persisted to this day in the disciplinary assumptions of Chinese journalism-communication, allowed the regime to depart from Maoism and legitimate a state-managed marketization. Excavating an unknown episode in the global history of cybernetics, this revisionist study sheds new light on the post-Mao trajectories of journalism and media governance. It also dislodges the ossified binaries between science and political ideology, and between socialist centralism and capitalist liberalism, which are prevalent in (post-)Cold War narratives.},

@article{Cordonnier2022Constituted,
  abstract = {Despite their explosive growth during the past decades, the sciences dedicated to communication are largely marginalized in the academic communities worldwide: Typically, their publications are not read, their theories ignored, their curricula not proposed in prestigious universities. The stigma these “fragmented” disciplines suffer from has important and interesting consequences for their development and beyond, for the contemporary understanding of the role of scientific knowledge in society. How does invisibilization affect the identity of our discipline(s) and of the researchers who inhabit it? What does it say about the intervention of social values into supposedly “neutral” scientific fields? The analysis of this partly documented situation relies upon a discursive approach requiring historical resources and, at the same time, a precise attention to heterogenous experiences that do not “fit” in historically situated normative academic frames. The approach shows how constituted and constituting exclusions of communication studies are linked by fundamental questions about where science “is” and what it “does,” epistemologically, practically, and politically. Identifying and acknowledging the power of sociocultural categories in structuring scientific practices leads us to put the authority, usefulness, and legitimacy of contemporary science in its proper intellectual, institutional, and sociocultural place.},

  abstract = { The rise of the critical blogosphere has challenged the authority of the mainstream media while sparking discussion concerning the proper relationship between news production and popular democracy in an Internet Age. All too often, however, this discussion is framed as a stark tension between aristocratic defenders of Old Media professionalism and democratic proponents of New Media egalitarianism. Lost in this framing is the tacit agreement, by both sides, that a solution must be found within the constraints of a corporate liberal media structure. This essay argues that if we are to make full use of the opportunities presented to us by new technologies, we must move beyond the discourse of corporate liberalism. Toward this end, I return to the philosophical debate between John Dewey and Walter Lippmann that occurred in the early part of the twentieth century. Based both on their shared principles and their points of departure, I argue that any productive discussion about democratic media reform must begin on the premise that we must supplement the current communication practices of corporate liberalism with noncommercial agencies of cooperative social inquiry and artistic news production. For both Dewey and Lippmann, only through creative investment of public resources can we facilitate intelligent and sympathetic collective judgment in a complex global environment. Their debate concerned only how and where to invest them. },

  abstract = {This commentary argues that communication research’s main problem is reputational. The field’s marginal status—a product of its peculiar institutional history, with roots in vocational training—means that our work is not read by scholars from other disciplines. My claim is that the vocational model exacts a steep reputational price. The gap in prestige between the mainline disciplines and communication means that our scholarship is simply not read. Exiled to the professional-school margins of the university, communication scholars toil away in well-heeled obscurity. In exchange for relinquishing jurisdiction over media and communication, the commentary concludes, we might join a dynamic crossroads—where the vocational underwriting will not loom as large. },

While the study points out to the existing divergent views on the declining rigor in the communication research—especially with respect to methodologies—in the West, it also suggests that the six parameters that Servaes (2015) together with Anderson and Middleton (2014, 2015) offered as an agenda to help improve the current paradigms of communication research is quite ideal for the pursuing de-westernizing media research in India. In the process, the study traverses through various conflicts between different methodologies in communication research and how new paradigms, prompted by the rapid emergence of new technologies, have come to play key role in re-defining the current methodologies in communication research. },

Communication research is increasingly divorced from the larger contexts of the humanities and social sciences. It may also risk being criticized for operating in historical and global vacuum. The solution is to return to what C. Wright Mills describes as the classic tradition of ‘intellectual craftsmanship’ that encourages the production of sociological imagination. },

  abstract = {Paulo Freire was a Brazilian thinker and educator. His pedagogic, academic and political trajectory left a vast legacy that is still of great relevance. However, his epistemological proposal has not been systematized despite of its importance for the field of critical communication research. In fact, he has been silenced, marginalized and misread in the academic agenda, both in the North and in the South, to fit research models which accommodate well to the neoliberal subjectivity, and which deactivate the transformative character of Freire’s proposal. In this article, we question Freire’s absence in dominant critical social theory, to subsequently synthesize Freirean epistemology as a cogno-emotional cycle with two juxtaposed ontological dimensions based on vulnerability and consciousness. We further question whether it is possible that the Freirean proposal serves as the general epistemological frame for practices and disciplines which are geared towards social transformation, namely, those which compose the field of socio-praxis. },

This article charts the recent rise and development of environmental communication, its successes and failures to produce public value. As the environmental crisis is the most crucial social and political issue of our time, there is a pressing need for environmental communication to engage with questions that are already familiar to scholars in media studies: questions about inequalities in power and resources – specifically among the gatekeepers influencing and shaping environmental communication – but also questions about the materiality of communication systems as environmentally hazardous machines. },

Our findings show that through low geopolitical diversity and high regional shares in authorship, editorial board membership, and citations, the Ibero-American region uses its structural, linguistic, and cultural resources to offer an alternative universe to mainstream English-based communication research. The article argues that the process of trailblazing the pathways to de-Westernizing communication scholarship is best accomplished when it is actively led by peripheral regions.},

Therefore, the best way to advance the pragmatist project is to turn philosophical questions about truth, morality, logic, aesthetics, or language into rhetorical questions about the best methods or practices for citizenship, leadership, inquiry, deliberation, public argument, and community building. Furthermore, the best way to improve democratic culture (and to realize Dewey's dream of the great community) is through attending to, promoting, and cultivating specific forms of rhetorical practice. The central claim of this essay is that by emphasizing the skills necessary for improving our circumstances and the practical application of knowledge for that task, pragmatism teaches us that rhetorical communication is the best available means of making our way as well as we can in a world marked by contingency, uncertainty, plurality, and social interaction.},

  abstract = {Richard McKeon (1900--1985) was a towering intellectual figure whose vast corpus of work is, outside a handful of essays, little read today. In the context of this volume, McKeon is noteworthy as someone who developed theories of both rhetoric and communication---explicitly so named---within a framework that his student Douglas Mitchell describes as ``Pragmatism in a new key.'' My overall aim in the essay is to draw together and extend the small but important body of commentary on McKeon's ``new key'' of pragmatism and his theories of both rhetoric and communication. I will show how they constitute a problem-oriented, pragmatist rhetorical philosophy for a historically evolving, pluralistic world marked by traditional and emergent communication practices and media technologies. In so doing, I intend to draw readers' attention to the fuller range of McKeon's writings on rhetoric and communication and offer overarching characterizations that make them more available than they have been to this point.},

  abstract = {Mills (1959) saw the true potential of sociology in exploring the link between micro-level human experience and macro-level societal trends and structures. And yet, sociological inquiry has largely overlooked micro-level approaches to a common quotidian American experience: watching television. Overemphasis on “top-down” approaches to studying television leads to three main misconceptions about television-watching and any micro-level approach to studying it: that the practice of watching television is too individualistic, too mundane, and too difficult to study. In fact, television-watching is social in myriad ways and, although mundane in its quotidian nature, is not devoid of complex power dynamics for sociological investigation. Research by scholars in other fields indicates that studying television at the micro-level is sometimes challenging, but possible. A truly effective and comprehensive sociology of television cannot exist until sociologists use phenomenological approaches to investigate people’s experience of structure in their lives, engaging micro- alongside macro-level perspectives. The promise of sociology of television, then, can only be realized by tapping the potential of phenomenological approaches to create a more complete understanding of television—one that must reconcile the power of institutions with agency, context, and experience in daily life.},

  abstract = {This article seeks to contribute and engage with debates pertaining to epistemology, knowledge production, and positionality of ‘International Communication Studies’ (ICS) in sub-Saharan Africa. The study operates on the assumption that International Communication studies in most Sub-Saharan Africa are characterized by tales of marginalization, poverty, wars, and tribal conflicts. While this approach speaks to the notion of development communication, it is insufficient to bolster the contributions of African scholarship to the global literature. In turn, ICS in Africa is treated as second class and dependent on Western scholarship for survival. Against this backdrop, the study interrogates the position of African scholarship, arguing that most research contributions are treated as repositories for raw data with no epistemological knowledge to contribute to the global network platform. },

  abstract = {Political communication is a dynamic, interdisciplinary field that has grown in stature and reach in recent decades, becoming more international in scope and orientation while gaining respect in political science as a legitimate area of inquiry. In the evolving and participatory media-politics landscape, it becomes important to ask how the cross-disciplinary project of political communication research is keeping pace with changing conditions that provide a greater structural role for the press in politics and new technology in the enactment of citizenship. To track these trends in research, this paper reports the results of a longitudinal content analysis of research articles published in the journals Political Communication and the International Journal of Press/Politics for the period 1996-2016. For each year, we selected one issue at random and examined all research articles in that issue, excluding reviews, invited theme essays, and commentaries. Altogether, 229 articles were included in the analysis. Results indicate a noticeable increase in the internationalization of political communication research over the 20-year analysis period, a slight decrease in research expressing a negative evaluative tone toward the media over time, and consistent growth in the percentage of articles with a media-centric focus, defined as positioning the press as a central consideration in the study and regarding news media as central to democratic life. In light of these findings, the unique interpretive lenses that researchers adopt depending on discipline are explored in relation to ongoing developments in political communication research. },

Issues of historical quantification and re-conceptualisation of public opinion are addressed in four parts. The first summarises the history of the rise and fall of the concept of public opinion. The second re-examines the key controversies in the debates on the theoretical, empirical and social implications and consequences of the invention of polling. The third part scrutinises the datafication of public opinion that started with polling industry and continues in the age of big data and data mining. The final section discusses the controversial potentials of opinion-mining technology and suggests ways in which social scientists could critically respond to the big data and opinion-mining challenges in order to reintegrate the ideas of publicness, the public and public sphere into public opinion research. },

  abstract = {This article develops the new concept of environing media against the case of Mexico’s complex history over the past five centuries. To do this, it stakes out a theoretical development consisting in a shift in understanding from media as content-delivery systems to data processors, combining it with a processual understanding of environment as an ongoing and historical process of environing. In addition, the article discusses examples of indigenous media, an area that has so far received very little attention. The Aztec empire was as dependent on media forms as the Spanish colonizers who replaced it, and there are numerous cases of knowledges and practices surviving in hybrid forms, for example as part of maps. For much of its history, the field of media studies has been biased toward questions of (1) ideological or attitudinal influence caused by (2) modern or emergent technologies. This article goes in another direction by thinking about media as (1) environing and (2) residual. Media are agencies of civilizational and environmental order. The rise of digital media in recent decades has reinforced the fundamental logistical role of media as agencies that arrange, catalog, organize, network, and index people, places, and things. Our understanding of media as fundamental constituents of organization joins the recent interest in infrastructures. Calendars, clocks, towers, names, addresses, maps, registers, arms, and money are all infrastructural media. Such media become second nature, morphing biorhythms and altering ecosystems. Today’s planetary digital infrastructure builds upon the long legacy of resource management via databases. We argue for a longer genealogy of the nature shaping logistical role of media that is so evident today. In this article, we refine and exemplify these claims via a case study of some environing media in Mexico, a country with a deep and rich media history. },

  abstract = { This article provides an alternative contribution to journalism studies on a foundational concept by analysing texts of Jane Addams, a public intellectual contemporary with the seminal scholars Walter Lippmann and John Dewey. The author uses methods of intellectual history to construct the concept of the public from Addams’s books: Democracy and Social Ethics and The Newer Ideals of Peace, showing that all three authors, Lippmann, Dewey and Addams, discuss the same topic of individuals’ changed engagement with public political life. Addams departs from Lippmann and Dewey in setting out from the standpoints of exclusion and cosmopolitanism. Her argument regarding the public, as constructed by the author, consists of two premises. First, public engagement is a method of democratic inclusion as well as social and political inquiry for Addams. She sees the extension of relationality across social divisions as a necessary method to understand society and materialise democracy. Second, Addams emphasises cooperative and reflexive involvement especially in the characteristic developments of a time. She considers industrialisation and cosmopolitanism as characteristic developments of her own era. Addams suggests an in-principle cosmopolitan concept of the public that includes marginalised persons and groups. Compared to Lippmann’s and Dewey’s accounts of the public, Jane Addams’s argument is more radical and far more sensitive to the social inequality and plurality of a drastically morphing society. },

  abstract = { This article offers a regional spotlight introduction to Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology. The question of what makes Canada unique has long preoccupied Canadian writers, artists, and policy makers, and is central to scholarly debates about Canadian sociology’s position relative to British, American, and other national sociologies, as well as the need for decolonization and diversification of the disciplinary canon. As a subfield, Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology receives little attention within these wider debates despite its emphasis on issues of cultural difference, identity, and evaluation. We provide an analysis of the dynamics of the field. Using course syllabi and survey data from instructors (N = 28), we examine whether there is a unique canon in Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology, and how cultural sociology is taught across Canada. Network analysis of texts assigned on syllabi and survey responses from cultural sociology instructors reveal, first, a thematic canon in Canadian cultural sociology, with a plurality of authors used to teach four main themes: identity and representation, cultural production, cultural consumption, and conceptualizing and measuring culture. Second, we find the positionality of Anglo-Canadian cultural sociology (with respect to both other national sociologies and neighboring subfields/disciplines) is uncertain and widely variant. Finally, survey responses concerning identity and representation suggest a reflexivity about the politics of canonization, and a gendered interest in decolonizing curricula. We conclude by arguing that a thematic canon in cultural sociology facilitates the maintenance of fuzzy boundaries with other subfields, national and Indigenous intellectual traditions, and a critical feminist lens. },

Building up on this, we argue that these research strands are inadequate to the task of exhaustively identifying foci of scientific interest. Tailoring for the fragmented topical landscape of communication research, we propose an integrative combination of three metrics: supply, popularity, and prestige of research topics.

Although authors have increasingly used stylistic cues in academic titles, articles with titles containing such cues were cited less frequently. Journal impact modified this relationship: The presence of a stylistic title was associated with more citations if the article was published in a lower impact journal, but fewer citations if it was published in a higher impact journal. Taken together, the results highlight a tension between authors’ attempts to distinguish their work in an increasingly crowded marketplace and readers’ general reluctance to cite scholarship containing stylistic title cues. },

Our study explores the extent to which this “audience turn” has unfolded in the education of future journalists. Drawing on data collected from course syllabi from leading journalism schools throughout the United States, we find that few journalism courses include aspects focused on news audiences. Those that include readings and/or assignments relating to news audiences maintain a narrow focus on audience metrics. We conclude by discussing what these trends mean for the future of journalism and the audience gap in journalism education. },

  abstract = { Although Brazil has its tradition of journalistic thinking, this essay shows that the discipline of journalism theory has, in this country, an intellectual nucleus based in the United States and Europe. It is true that both academic cultures provide foundations, but they do not claim to provide explanations about the society in which Brazilian journalism developed. This argument is corroborated by the analysis of the bibliographic references used by Brazilian courses. Considering that the impetus for the de-Westernization must come from scholars in emerging countries, this essay argues that the curriculum could be a key element to incite this transformation. },

  abstract = {Demographics may influence the results and implications of mass communication research. Yet, there is a dearth of studies exploring the extent to which research in the field reports participants’ demographics and the composition of its study samples. This content analysis takes an identity theory and ecological systems theory approach to examine participants’ demographic characteristics in all mass communication studies conducted in the U.S. and published in six peer-reviewed journals from 2000 to 2014 (N = 1,278). According to our census, three-fourths of the studies reported gender, two-thirds reported age, two-fifths reported race/ethnicity and one-third reported education. While the reporting of demographics improved during the 15-year period, participants continued to be mostly educated, young, White women. In light of these findings, our theoretical framework contends that many of these studies may paint an incomplete picture of the role media play in the lives of the U.S. users and audiences. Furthermore, reporting of participants’ demographics as well as sample composition differed by research methods and subdisciplines, thus revealing a lack of standard protocols across the discipline. Findings from this study encourage researchers to systematically record, report and analyze participant demographics, as well as to take into account participants’ heterogeneity within these demographic groups. },

Using the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR) database, we collected data on publications appearing in 400 communication journals between 1990 and 2019. Our findings demonstrate a proportionate decline in Northern American authorial dominance over time, although scholars from the region continue to publish far more often than scholars from any other part of the world. Further, scholars in Northern America and parts of Europe publish in higher-ranked journals and are cited at higher rates than their colleagues in the Global South, who are more likely to publish in lower-ranked and regional journals. Overall, these geographic disparities in journal authorship demonstrate the enduring colonial legacy of scholarly knowledge production in the field of communication.},

In this article, I draw on my experiences as an African graduate student in an American classroom to highlight the ways that systemic racism is replicated, reproduced and frames pedagogy. I argue that although many communication(s) scholars purport to theorize from a radical perspective, these politics are not represented in their pedagogy which means that students from marginalized communities are often erased in discussions on theory, research methods and even pedagogy. Not only are the epistemological experiences and realities of marginalized students erased, but the canon is further legitimized leading to the training of scholars and teachers who go on to (in)advertently uphold racism, White supremacy, colonialism, and imperialism in their research, teaching and service.},

This article tries to remedy this by recovering the voices of women via eight in-depth interviews among prominent researchers (second-generation, 1960s–1970s) from Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Italy, the UK, and the US. The results illustrate the inequality, sexual harassment, lack of legitimacy, and stereotypes faced by these women, and their strong emotional leadership. Their stories of success show how academia is a field of struggle where hegemony, domination, and resistance coexist. However, female experiences in academia are diverse and complex. That is why the article concludes with the need to continue tracking the stories of so many different women as knowing subjects, as well as the challenges of intersectionality in the epistemological construction of the field.},

  abstract = {In July 1969 the U.S. House of Representatives Judiciary Antitrust Subcommittee met to reconvene its hearings on conglomerate corporations. The guests that day were the top executives at Gulf & Western Industries, a company that, just over a decade earlier, had been a middling auto parts manufacturer with $8 million in total sales. Eleven years, 127 mergers, and two name changes later, Gulf & Western had morphed into a sprawling empire with a cornucopia of products—from paint pigment and traffic lights to soul records and cigars—amounting to more than $1.3 billion in annual sales. Speaking on behalf of the firm, the Gulf & Western president David Judelson framed his opening statement with a series of rhetorical questions: “What is Gulf \\&amp; Western? Who is Gulf \\&amp; Western? How and why has Gulf \\&amp; Western developed?” His response was that the firm represented something altogether new in American life: a corporation that made diversification—the act of branching out into many unrelated fields—its foundational premise. True, this process required an aggressive acquisitions stance, but the end result was something of value: “a federation of small-, medium-, and large-sized corporations.” After hours of testimony, the subcommittee chair Emanuel Celler remained unconvinced. “Are you familiar with [Wolfgang Amadeus] Mozart's opera Don Giovanni,” he asked the Gulf \\&amp; Western chief executive Charles Bluhdorn. The Viennese émigré was not, but he quipped that perhaps Paramount Pictures, a Gulf \\&amp; Western subsidiary, could make a film version. Unamused, Celler described a scene in which Giovanni's servant was asked how many mistresses the legendary Lothario kept; the servant responded by producing a chronicle that, when unfurled, spanned the entire stage. “I cannot help but make a comparison,” the chairman deadpanned, “between your Gulf & Western and Don Giovanni.”},

  abstract = {Like many fields of communication research, journalism scholarship draws on theories from other disciplines and mostly applies social theories to make sense of journalistic practices. One theory that has gained immense popularity in recent years is Pierre Bourdieu’s field theory. However, while there are now numerous studies using his concepts, we have little comprehensive understanding of how scholarship applies them. To this end, this study conducts a systematic analysis of 249 articles, using content analysis, textual analysis and citation analysis to examine how field theory is adopted and adapted, as well as who has interpretative authority in shaping Bourdieusian thought in journalism research. The findings suggest a selective in-depth use of field theory and that the appropriation of some concepts is still ambiguous. Moreover, it highlights once more the dominance of Western scholarship in the academic field. },

Despite these outstanding achievements, hegemonic notions that present theory as irrelevant to education for a Caribbean `labour force' have hindered the evolution of a distinctive Caribbean paradigm in communication thought. This chapter calls for the need for a more integrated Caribbean paradigm in communication research, analysis and theory building, to counter the still dominant imported content and ideas. It also suggests a `review of the ontological, epistemological and methodological assumptions of European and North American media and communication approaches to theory'. The study seeks to move Caribbean people from being mere recipients of knowledge for utilitarian/work purposes to being `active creators of another perspective for understanding human communication and media'.},

It discusses a turn to “nature” and the elements that has pushed media studies beyond its traditional objects and subjects. While the conceptualization of environments and bodies as communicative substrates offers new avenues for media research, mediation has also been taken up in a wide range of disciplinary and intellectual contexts. Rather than establishing limits or an essential core of media studies, the article suggests that media scholars take an etic orientation and attend to the questions whose invisibility is constitutive of the field. Using the example of undersea cable systems, the article describes some of the many conceptual, institutional, and pedagogical ends of media analysis.},

I discuss their work comparatively, throwing new light on each by historicizing them in relation to dual strands of modernism linked with scientific knowing and artistic making. In the process, I bring out physiological and naturalistic dimensions of their expansive theories of rhetoric, showing how they were anchored by sensing bodies interacting with evolving worlds.},

In the photograph, taken by feminist photographer Lorie Novak, Bustamante sits on top of an impossibly tall ladder, her back turned to us, a spotlight reproducing her body and the ladder in the form of a shadow against a white backdrop. In the piece, Bustamante dons various accoutrements of white womanhood, most prominently a blond wig that the artist uses to great effect to illustrate the ways in which minoritarian subjects inevitably fail to meet the demands to assimilate into what Muñoz once called the normatively white “cultural logics that…work to undergird state power.”1 This image can’t help but strikingly recall the cover of Muñoz’s first monograph, Disidentifications: Queers of Color and the Performance of Politics (1999), which features a photograph of multidisciplinary artist Vaginal Davis by the gay Chicano photographer Rick Castro. Although here Davis sits closer to the frame, her body turned toward us while she delicately glances away from our gaze, another blond wig directs our attention, resting on the artist’s head in contrast to her Black skin. As in Bustamante’s piece, the blondness of the wig offers an almost ironic commentary on the ways in which minoritarian subjects (and artists) must constantly negotiate their existence and work within a white majoritarian public (and aesthetic) sphere.},

I was not consciously invoking José Esteban Muñoz’s work with this formulation, but in retrospect it should have been obvious. Muñoz invokes with in his theories of how disidentifications, queerness, and brownness are affectively performed as he draws on television, video art, film, installation, art, theater, and performance—media that he approaches more as expressive than as representational.},

  abstract = {I first met José Esteban Muñoz through his writing in the collection Pop Out: Queer Warhol (1996), which he co-edited with Jennifer Doyle and Jonathan Flatley while still a graduate student. At the time I was writing a dissertation chapter on Warhol’s films that read the Factory and Warhol’s production methods as examples of collective, non-singular authorship. Like Warhol, Muñoz strikes me as first and foremost an artist of the social, a person working in the social as if it were a medium. And while Muñoz’s The Sense of Brown (2020) is in some ways a book about Latinx art and culture, it is not a book about identity or an identity group—nor any other notion of discrete, disconnected personhood that the terms “author” and “artist” can evoke. The term “brown commons” is carefully chosen in Muñoz’s final book to suggest something less proprietary than identity, less proprietary even than community, people, or collectivity, the first two of which suggest implicit membership criteria and the idea that different groups might be set against one another (“my” community, “my” people), the last of which conveys the sense of individuals coming together and sharing resources according to a system of apportionment (a collectively run business). The phrase “my commons” would be an oxymoron, the exclusionary vibe of the first-person possessive rendering the idea absurd. Nor is it easy to imagine a business run on the principles of “commons decision-making” or “commons profit-sharing.” The commons is that which by definition cannot be privatized or individuated—not even in democratic or equitable ways. The commons resists division. It is a magic circle that anyone can walk or drop into and out of, where animals can graze and gather to play, a resource that is not used up, but instead increases its bounty the more times it is accessed and spread around.},

@article{10.1525/aft.2022.49.1.53,
  abstract = {One of the many facets of José Esteban Muñoz’s work that has repeatedly proved significant for my writing and thinking is the articulation of an essential yet anti-essentialist communitarian politics underpinning the primary theoretical concepts for which he’s widely known. Whether it’s Muñoz’s appraisal of minoritarian disidentifications with dominant cultural ideologies or the not-yet-here utopian promise of queer futurity, such influential critical frameworks are invariably bolstered by an astute assessment of how subjugated groups, through a range of expressive forms, articulate practices of collectivity that necessarily push against the grain of normative understandings of community and antirelational modes of being. In “The Brown Commons,” the first chapter of his posthumously published book The Sense of Brown (2020), Muñoz extends his earlier desire to put forward a “version of queer social relations” that is at once “critical of the communitarian as an absolute value and of its negation as an alternative all-encompassing value.”1 “Brown commons,” he asserts, “is the commons of brown people, places, feelings, sounds, animals, minerals, flora, and other objects.”2 And just as he stakes claims for provisional notions of solidarity and belonging in his earlier work, Muñoz makes clear that the “brown” in brown commons is not a fixed identity category but rather a capacious signifier encompassing those who “have been devalued by the world outside their commons.”3 Furthermore, the brown commons “is not about the production of the individual but instead about a movement, a flow, and an impulse to move beyond the singular subjectivity and the individualized subjectivities.”4 In short, the establishment of a brown commons materializes not as a wholly formed cooperative based on assimilation or coexistence vis-à-vis individuation; rather, it is premised on the knowledge of a sense of brownness—an affective approximation more than a rigid racialized inscription, a shared feeling of collectiveness that is both historically anchored and persistently in flux—“that is our commonality.”5},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the interior monologue as a “sonic thing” whose elusive nature prompted a wide range of research initiatives in the long twentieth century. Neurophysiologists, developmental psychologists, psychoanalysts, and linguists shared an increasing interest in what humans hear when talking and listening to themselves. From diverse disciplinary perspectives, they agreed that “interior monologues” or related phenomena such as “inner speech” are crucial to human cognition, the psyche, and the faculty of speech. And all of them saw these phenomena as constituting important theorems in their own disciplines. In order to investigate interior monologues, the scholars and scientists presented here attempted to turn them inside out, making creative use of a great variety of research tools. A pivotal figure in this respect was the Stanford-based linguist Ruth Hirsch Weir, who, in 1962, produced magnetic tape recordings of her son’s “crib talk”. Interpreting the infant monologue as a precursor of the interior monologues of adults, Hirsch Weir brought together seemingly irreconcilable work on “inner language” by Lev Vygotsky, Sigmund Freud, and Roman Jakobson. In turn, her study inspired a series of further research initiatives – among them Jacques Lacan’s work on the “autonomous play of speech” in children and adults. },

For each of these three JDPs, one key theoretical figure functions as a historiographical guide. Walter Benjamin leads the way for JDP1999. Friedrich Kittler guides JDP 2009. Harold Innis hovers, Google Earth-like, above JDP 2019. The dominant forms of historical evidence are also fundamentally different. JDP 1999 delves into the hidden philosophies and theologies of communication buried in canonical Western texts. JDP 2009 opens up the diagrams, patents, and formulas of scientists and engineers used in the creation of media. JDP 2019 examines the ‘natural world’ as the inscription of being that encodes and decodes itself into existence. A further distinction to be made between JDP 2009 and JDP 2019 regards tools and knowledge of the natural world, both of which figure prominently in the histories discussed. The natural world preexists tools and humans. Its history is deeply inhuman, whereas the history of ideas and of tools is clearly not.

  abstract = {This essay considers the deployment of a nineteenth-century white-supremacist imaginary within popular culture and, more curiously, within feminist media historiography. Tracing the paradoxical figure of the “female film pioneer” to groundbreaking work by Ally Acker and Jane Gaines in the 1990s, I historicize how the “pioneers” initially functioned as strategic interventions in a white masculinist landscape, but argue that they have since become naturalized in post-millennial digital culture and are (mis)shaping the discourse of the field. Leaning on foundational texts by Ella Shohat and Robert Stam and Emma Pérez, this paper intervenes in the pioneer paradigm so prevalent in the study of the silent film era—and in discourse on female film and video makers more generally—calling for a proliferation of metaphors to provoke new insights into the very real challenges facing feminists in the present.},

  abstract = {There is nothing especially surprising or controversial in observing the significant influence that cybernetics exerted on music, especially in its heyday during the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s. Indeed, it is hard to see how things might have been otherwise. Cybernetics was distinct from traditional sciences in aspiring to create a universal interdiscipline that patched together the probabilistic worldview of information theory and the flattened abstractions of systems theory.1 Its founding Macy conferences of 1946–53 assembled a cross-disciplinary network of intellectuals, the majority of whom worked in what would now be termed STEM disciplines, but some (and some of the most influential) were drawn from social science, linguistics, literary theory, and management theory.2 Many of the scientists were returning to universities having undertaken war research, and the specter of totalitarianism shaped the overarching ethos of collaboration and cooperation that both the conferences and cybernetics itself would embody.3 Some believed that the superdiscipline could contribute to a postwar “Unity of Science” movement based on the universal concepts of information, feedback, and homeostasis,4 and in this way we can see cybernetics as aligned with supranational efforts to restore and protect liberalism following the war.5 Yet scholarship of the past 30 years has suggested that it was via its extra-scientific mediation that cybernetics secured such a foothold in the 20th- and 21st-century imagination.6 As Geoffrey Bowker put it: “Where traditional sciences operated behind the walls of the laboratory, cybernetics was everywhere you went. Where traditional sciences repudiated all possible mention of society, cybernetics proclaimed that it could produce the best possible description thereof, and that its universal truth was immediately tied to this historical conjuncture.”7 Bowker suggests that these factors worked together to position cybernetics as a “distributed obligatory passage point” capable of translating knowledge between incommensurate languages and facilitating exchanges of legitimacy in the process,8 and from one perspective the cybernetic traces in music are simply an affirmation of this. They show how successfully cyberneticians managed to consolidate their universal discipline across intellectual spheres, describing and to an extent creating the conditions of a new technological age—famously dubbed the “age of communication and control” by Norbert Wiener.},

  abstract = {Despite its ubiquity in both academic and popular discourses on music, the concept of musical style last received in-depth scholarly treatment three decades ago, in music theorist Leonard Meyer’s final book, Style and Music of 1989. Meyer’s text remains widely cited today, but its date obscures the even earlier origins of its central concerns in Meyer’s work of the 1950s and ’60s. Indeed, Meyer developed his most enduring ideas amidst an array of momentous intellectual changes, not least of which were the rise (and fall) of information theory and cybernetics, and the transition from behaviorist to cognitive psychology, both of which impacted his work and legacy in lasting ways.While Meyer’s general understanding of musical style remained largely consistent across his career, this essay examines a series of subtle shifts in the details of his conception as his intellectual focus shifted from pragmatist philosophy to a wholesale engagement with information theory to, eventually, cognitive psychology. Meyer’s most important early influences were American pragmatists like John Dewey and Morris R. Cohen, but already by 1957 he argued for a continuity between the mathematical structure of Markov chains and the pragmatist theories of meaning and emotional response on which his famous Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956) was based. While explicit mention of information theory soon dropped out of his writings, I show how information and computation continue to resonate throughout his later works and, thus, how they live on in current music-theoretical notions of style.},

  abstract = {In her book An Individual Note (1972), Daphne Oram developed multiple extended analogies between humans and electronic sound technologies. Oram used these to suggest how “music and information theory, allied to technology” might be applied to mental health; and to support her design for a machine that would preserve human qualities through its interactivity and musical results. This music machine, Oram wrote, “is based mainly on controlled feedback and the computing of resultants.…It is a control system which could be applied to many fields, as well as music.”Analogies between organisms and machines, core concepts of control and feedback, information theory: These suggest a cybernetic cast to Oram’s work. As Dunbar-Hester (2010) has observed, however, some experimental musicians drew directly from cybernetic sources, while others employed cybernetic-sounding language without such explicit engagement. To date, Oram has figured in neither camp, scholarly interests having been directed primarily toward her pioneering position in the male-dominated field of electronic music. Drawing on archival work at the Daphne Oram Collection at Goldsmiths, University of London, this article uncovers sources and conditions that informed Oram’s relationship to cybernetic science and aesthetics. As Oram pursued a program of music research and invention in the 1960s–70s, cybernetics offered a vocabulary, methodology, and ontology that interfaced the worlds of computer art and scientific progress with those of spiritualism and higher sense perception. At the same time, Oram’s commitment to authorial control for the composer put her at odds with the interests in indeterminacy and self-generating systems predominant among artists publicly recognized as cybernetic. The uneasy fit between Oram’s work and music’s cybernetic canon points toward a “scientific-spiritual space” (Pickering, 2010) that existing historiographies of electronic music have not fully recognized, and shows there is far more than Oram as woman that needs to be written back into history.},

  abstract = {In his Théorie de l’information et perception esthétique (1958), the sociologist of culture Abraham Moles (1920–92) set out to demonstrate the applicability of information theory—a mathematical linchpin of cybernetics—to the arts more generally. Moles drew on classical psychophysics, Gestalt psychology, more modern behavioral psychology, and contemporary psychoacoustic research to advocate a cybernetic model of the perception and creation of art. Moles repeatedly returned to musical examples therein to make his case, leveraging his dual expertise in philosophy and electroacoustics, drawing on formative experiences with Pierre Schaeffer in Paris and Hermann Scherchen at his Gravesano studio. Moles’s interdisciplinary text found many attentive readers across Europe and, following an English translation by the precocious Joel E. Cohen (1966), the Anglophone academic world, but it was valued more as an inspiration for the burgeoning area of “information aesthetics” than as a source of hard scientific evidence.Drawing lightly on positions in the history and philosophy of science articulated by Gaston Bachelard (who supervised Moles’s second PhD, in philosophy) and Hans-Jörg Rheinberger suggests a change of emphasis away from its apparent scientific infelicities and toward Moles’s use of sound-studio technique, which is described with reference to the technologies available to Moles in the years leading up to the publication of the Théorie. Moles manipulated and processed sound recordings—filtering, clipping, and reversing them—in his attempts to empirically estimate the relative proportions of semantic and aesthetic information in speech and music. Moles’s text, when understood in tandem with the traces of his practical experiments in the sound studio, appears as an influential and occasionally prescient exposition of the many possible applications of the principles of information theory to the production, perception, and consumption of sound culture that makes ready use of the latest technical innovations in the media environment of its time.},

Building on the work of James Bryce, Lindsay Rogers, Herbert Blumer, Paul Lazarsfeld, and more, this essay revisits the discipline’s historical roots and draws parallels between past theory and present practice. Today, scholars treat public opinion as the summation of individual attitudes, weighted equally and expressed anonymously at static points in time through polls, yet prior to the advent of survey research, it was conceived as something intrinsically social and dynamic. In an era dominated by online discussion boards and social media platforms, the insights of this earlier “classical tradition” offer two pathways forward. First, for those who criticize computational social science as poorly theorized, it provides a strong justification for the work that data scientists do in text mining and sentiment analysis. And second, it offers clues for how emerging technologies might be leveraged effectively for the study of public opinion in the future.},

  abstract = {This study aims to look into the cultural roots in the active construction of indigenous Chinese communication theories. Theoretically guided by the paradigmatic cultural assumptions between China and the West and the Chinese cultural discourse system and research, and via qualitative content analysis, this study has found: First, there are three general categories of indigenous Chinese communication theories: (a) tapping the essence of the traditional Chinese culture embedded in terms, concepts and events, (b) visualizing and modeling the Chinese cultural factors like wind, grass, and water, and (c) integrating the advantages of Chinese and Western cultures, with each category illustrated by three representative samples. Second, the three categories are the three adopted approaches to fulfilling the three goals of the Chinese cultural discourse system and three missions of the Chinese cultural discourse research. The findings can bring about complimentary and mutual benefits to the communication studies within China and beyond.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the role of strategic argumentation on behalf of certain focusing events in the discourse on Cultural Education in Germany. The idea of an education by culture was reflected in the policy programmes of the New Cultural Policy and Socioculture that connected cultural policy to a social agenda in the 1970s. In the last few decades, it has gained further importance through the development of educational and cultural governance. By analysing policy papers, journals and compendiums by associations as well as project descriptions, the research elucidates the main arguments that policy actors refer to in lobbying for Cultural Education, and critically questions the role that is assigned to culture and cultural institutions. },

Buried in federal records, a post-Act Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Pursuant that mandated analysis of educational broadcasting additionally turns out to be the causative reason that Theodor Adorno was brought to America by the Rockefeller Foundation. Crucial to the intellectual history of media and communication theory, Lazarsfeld invited Adorno not only to develop techniques to inform educational music study, but to strategically formulate advocacy language for the media reform movement to help noncommercial media obtain frequency licenses. The limits and pressures exerted by the FCC Pursuant influenced the trajectory of the PRRP research, and consequently, the methodological investments of Communication Studies.},

  abstract = {This article reflects on the career of cultural and media studies figure, John Fiske, from both a personal and a scholarly perspective. Fiske was an influential force within the development of cultural studies and television studies over the 1980s and 1990s, and a much-loved and respected teacher and mentor. He was also a controversial figure at times. Fiske was accused of cultural populism, of revisionism, and an unwarranted optimism about the political agency of media consumers. While this article does not take on such accusations in any detail, it sets out to demonstrate the importance of a proper accounting for his career that also recognizes some of its less widely known aspects – such as his critical investment in building cultural studies during his eight years working in Australia. The article also highlights the potential difficulties ahead for cultural studies’ writing of its own histories of contestation and debate. },

  abstract = {Why people still rely on misinformation after clear corrections is a major concern driving relevant research. Different fields, from psychology to marketing, have been seeking answers. Yet there remains no systematic review to integrate these theoretical and empirical insights. To fill the gap, this article reviewed 135 articles on misinformation correction and its effects written before 2020 to examine the knowledge generated in the field. Our findings indicate a consistent interest on this topic over the past four decades, and a sharp increase of relevant scholarly work in the last ten years. Nevertheless, most studies have been built upon psychological inquiries and quantitative methodologies. What is lacking includes longitudinal measurements of debunking effectiveness, theoretical insights beyond cognitive sciences, methodological contributions from qualitative approaches, and empirical evidence from non-western societies. With this analysis, we propose worthwhile focuses for future exploration. },

  abstract = { This article returns to the geopolitical scene and racial logics that provide the underacknowledged conditions of Marshall McLuhan’s Understanding Media and, specifically, its well-known proposition that media should be understood foremost as ‘outerings’ or ‘extensions of man’. Attending to the structuring inheritances of racial slavery and the plantation system in this founding statement of mid-twentieth-century media theory, as well as its debt to the literary and intellectual movement of the Southern Agrarians, I consider how the racializing figure of ‘Man’ conserved by the nascent field of media studies was contemporaneously brought to crisis by black (and) anticolonial freedom struggles. Arguing for the need to reread the career of western media theory through its political vocation in attempting to manage this crisis, the article concludes by turning briefly to a revisionary account of media and exteriority also circulated in 1964: the revolutionary intellectual James Boggs’s ‘The Negro and Cybernation’. Boggs’s writings, which situate emergent forms of computing and cybernation within a longer materialist genealogy of race, capitalism and technology, offer both a proleptic critique of the early disciplinary formation of media theory and a divergent set of coordinates for approaching media technology on the terrain of black political struggle. },

This article reconstructs the last 60 years of journalism studies in Brazil considering the relations established with France since the first scholars at the Institut Français de Presse, but also semioticians, historians, sociologists and philosophers from other institutions. This overview, focused on those who have received French approaches, shows the main trends and challenges that Brazilian scholars have been dealing with developing their own works in methodological and theoretical terms. Each study is commented on within its respective field of knowledge—such as language, sociology, anthropology and history—and then compared with the others. The key argument is that there are several and even conflicting French references that guide the approaches and understandings adopted by journalism researchers in Brazil. },

  abstract = {Michel Serres’s work traces a historical transition where technologies of mediation replace a framework of life formerly managed by an economics of production. Readings of Serres tend to affirm in this transition the opening to an ecology (econarratology or media-ecology) or towards a replacement of the human in trans- or post-humanism. In this article I analyse the terms of the transition in Serres’s affirmation of a philosophy grounded in the potential for connection between the traditions of storytelling and the sciences of connection. The article rediscovers within his overt Hellenism a figure of the Anthropos affirmed in the Sophist philosophies that Plato had set out to destroy. If science proceeds, first in its Hellenic dawn, and more recently in seventeenth century arithmetic, then it must be disabused of its war-game attitude. Serres affirms science (almost singularly) as the condition on which the species might continue its adventure into the future, and in the process he establishes a position that may challenge ecologically oriented discourses.},

  abstract = {Media, to Michel Serres, are not solely a cultural praxis, technology, or institution; in his circumstantial universalism, there is a veritable metaphysics of milieu at work. At the core of Serres’ relevancy for media theory (on whose project this article focuses mainly) is the architectonic status of public knowledge in what he calls the Chronopedia. This architectonics involves radical re-conceptions of space and time that allow philosophy, at least in principle, to maintain compatibility with contemporary science and technology. This article profiles two related projects in the light of each other, that of a Grand Récit of the Universe (Michel Serres) and that of The Unnameable Present (Roberto Calasso). For both projections, there appears nothing more urgent today than re-connecting a broad public vocabulary, repository of images and ideas, puzzles too, as well as expectations and understandings with regard to the abstractions and powers at work in the technology and science that organise how we live today, in the dawn of the Anthropocene.},

In the early 1960s, press professionals, engineers, and telecom officials from the global South elaborated a wide-ranging structural critique of the status quo, arguing that developing mass media required decolonizing international networks and global governance practices that perpetuated media inequality. But over the course of the decade, UNESCO began to invite research and expertise from American social scientists and engineers, who came to define UNESCO’s approach to satellite-based media development. By redefining the scope of media development to an instrumentalist vision of Westernization, such research eclipsed a broad, structural vision of reform, casting southern experts’ more radical designs into shadow. By recovering this history, the article tells a new story of the ideologies and governance practices that helped sustain global news inequality in the satellite age.},

We analyze the titles, keywords, and abstracts of 2,585 articles published between 1994–2007 and 2008–2016. We find differences between topics in the two periods in each of the journals’ groups and between the two groups themselves. In the European group, we find centrality of topics related to media change and media logic. In the ICA journals, we find a strengthening of scholarly engagement with effects studies. At the same time, we find evidence of erosion of the place of cultural studies as a distinctive research stream. },

  abstract = {{Lotte Eisner was a woman of many talents: a writer, archivist and curator who could draw on wide-ranging interests and a stupendous knowledge that went far beyond film history into other, varied fields of culture, including literature and philosophy, theatre and architecture, music and the visual arts. The three books she wrote on the history of the cinema – The Haunted Screen first published in French in 1952, and her books on F. W. Murnau from 1964 and Fritz Lang from 1974 – reflect this range of expertise. While all three books are primarily conceived as studies in visual composition and film style and thus betray Eisner’s art-historical training, they differ in instructive ways with regard to how she approaches each project.}},

Murnau was ‘the greates[t film director the Germans have ever known […] He created the most overwhelming, the most stunning images on the German screen.’1 If we look back carefully at The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt and at Murnau, we can see that Eisner presents the director’s achievements in an entirely different way in each book.2 Unlike the four chapters devoted to Murnau’s films in The Haunted Screen, Eisner structures her monograph on the director as a defence against charges that he did not deserve credit for the artistic and technical qualities so much admired in his films. How did this challenge arise so persuasively that Eisner felt compelled to mount a strong argument against it?}},

Because the Film-Kurier depended in part on the placement of advertising by film producers, Weiner cautioned her, it was not good business to run negative reviews. He advised Eisner to stick to reviewing films she would be able to praise, however faint such praise might be. Eisner introduces this chapter in the memoirs on her years at the Film-Kurier by describing herself as the first female German film critic, always given the least important, least interesting assignments: ‘I rushed from one deadline to the next, and initially got the unpleasant tasks that no one else wanted to do – all manner of undesirable editorial duties, first among them covering the Ufa Kulturfilme. You cannot imagine something more boring and odious.’1}},

  abstract = {{A curious paradox haunts the work of the exile Jewish writer, archivist and curator Lotte H. Eisner. Fabled for her writings on Weimar cinema as well as auteur studies of Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, Eisner also enjoys legendary status as a doyenne of the French and German New Waves during her three decades as Chief Curator at the Cinémathèque française.1 But she is at the same time a strangely elusive presence, even amongst critics who share her view of ‘visceral […] atmospheric’ mise-en-scene as Weimar cinema’s signal contribution to film art. Patrice Petro deems Eisner ‘almost certainly right’ for her incisive delineation, in her seminal post-war study The Haunted Screen, of Weimar cinema’s ‘distinctive moods’.2 Thomas Elsaesser similarly counts himself amongst Eisner’s ‘followers’, and draws at length on her writings on lighting, set design, camera, editing and directorial practice for his account of Weimar cinema as ‘Germany’s historical imaginary’.3 Elsaesser recognizes Eisner’s incisive grasp of cinema as a medium with the capacity to shape both fictional and lived worlds, and in so doing to help generate new social imaginaries. Yet Eisner remains for him a writer engaged in an ‘essentially stylistic history’ of German aesthetic practice from Romanticism through Expressionism to interwar film.4 In histories of Weimar criticism, Eisner’s significance is similarly underplayed, despite her extensive contributions during her time as journalist and editor on the daily trade paper Film-Kurier to the period’s lively cultural discourse on the new film medium. Archive histories, meanwhile, hint at but do not extensively investigate Eisner’s formative role in building, documenting and presenting the vast archival collections of the Cinémathèque française;5 conversely, critics have been quick to disparage her views on the apparently ‘innate’ German sensibility or ‘soul’ of Weimar cineastes – terms dismissed as critically obsolete, even while Eisner’s status as a venerated film-historical grande dame seems secure.6}},

  abstract = {This article addresses the political dimensions of Johan Huizinga’s seminal work Homo Ludens: A study of the play element in culture (1938). More than just a foundational text in academic ludology, this text positioned itself as a polemic against the right-wing political discourse going on in contemporaneous Nazi Germany, represented chiefly by Carl Schmitt. Through his concept of play, Huizinga hoped to resolve what he perceived to be the confusion of play and seriousness among a group of reactionary theorists narrowly focused on the Schmittian Ernstfall, the “serious case” of inimical violence. This article analyzes the usage of the concepts of “play” and “seriousness” in Huizinga’s and Schmitt’s respective corpuses and, finally, places their work in dialogue in order to understand the difficulties involved in defining play as unserious and unpolitical. },

  abstract = {The crisis of World War I, including the challenges of reporting from the fighting front, sparked public discussion about the reliability and status of journalism. In response, unprecedented changes to the education of journalists were introduced around the world, including in Australia. By the 1920s, the majority of Australian universities offered a Diploma in Journalism, developed in collaboration with the Australian Journalists’ Association (AJA). Yet despite the AJA’s commitment to developing professional standards, by 1945 these courses were either defunct or struggling. This article explores the introduction and subsequent failure of tertiary journalism education in the context of discussions within the AJA about educational ‘relevance’, and whether journalists required improved ‘thinking’ or improved ‘skills’. Analysis of the establishment of these university courses highlights debates around the professionalism, status, and ethical practice of journalism in the interwar years, at a time when the newspaper industry was expanding. },

  abstract = {This study deals with the Czechoslovak film school FAMU from its inception until the 1960s. Several specific issues from the history of the institution are selected. The study examines to what extent the establishment of the school was influenced by the Communist Party (which strongly influenced Czechoslovak cultural policy from 1945 before seising monopolistic political power in February 1948) and if the Soviet VGIK was really a model for FAMU, as is sometimes maintained. The second area of interest is the production practice of student films, which the author uses to illustrate the institutional, as well as broader social and political changes in the school during the first 25 years of its existence. Emphasis is placed on topics such as students’ creative freedom (including their occasionally dissenting approaches), formal versus real competencies in the initiation of a film project, approval mechanisms and possible circumvention of the given rules, etc. The study works with those student films that were officially distributed in Czechoslovakia at the time. It is based on original archival and oral history research combined with secondary sources, including commemorative audio-visual works. The study’s methodological approach is rooted in the history of film institutions, production studies, and the political history of film. },

But it is worth reflecting on the impetus for the journal, because the reasons for bringing it into being remain relevant. There is still a need for spaces in which to publish smart, critical writing about popular music; there is even more need for that writing to be valued, to be counted, as legitimate scholarship, whether it hews to traditional scholarly forms (e.g., journal articles) or not.},

While the rich media ecology scholarship has focused primarily on the realm of effects, emerging applications of the moral ecology concept are shifting that focus onto the sociological processes and organizational structures involved in the formation of moral dispositions and standards. This project promotes an argument for why moral ecology should be considered an essential focus of media sociology research in general and media ethics scholarship in particular. Such a focus spotlights the organizational-level factors that serve to help or hinder the ability of media workers to act virtuously and uphold professional norms.}},

  abstract = {This article explores the many parallels – but also discontinuities – between the interpersonal communication medium and research enterprise pursued by Elihu Katz and Paul Lazarsfeld in Personal Influence (1955) and the social media agenda and associated research enterprise of Facebook and Instagram. The essay begins with a discussion of ‘personal influence’ as the concept was first developed in the 1950s, outlining its historical context and initial limited application. It then shows how key ideas of Personal Influence can be seen as having been applied and embedded in the very fabric of social media itself. Yet Facebook represents a significant departure from both Katz and Lazarsfeld’s research agenda and from the market research and information regime of traditional media. Their audience research work of 1955 was avowedly public and transparent in its commitments. They were providing a market research product for advertising agencies, advertisers and media providers to re-purpose. In contrast, Facebook is private, proprietorial and opaque in its research provision. Facebook combines, under one roof, the roles of market research provider, media provider, and advertising agency. By prioritizing the collection and analysis of individual user profiles, Facebook has created a media enterprise that seamlessly integrates user-generated content, data collection, analysis, strategy, media provision and associated advertising machinery. },

  abstract = {This article reflects with affection on the work of the late Professor Tom O’Regan, in his interwoven capacities as scholar, teacher, colleague, friend, catalyst, and generous mentor to younger scholars. It attempts to convey the intellectual openness, curiosity, and conversations with others that shaped his research in Media and Cultural Studies, and to make visible the skeins of connective tissue across his many collaborations and projects. It traces the recent trajectories of his ideas from cultural discourse to policy, to audience measurement, to media platforms and algorithmic culture. It attends to his particular ability to see how seemingly disparate people, events, objects, and ideas related to each other, and to bring these elements into conversation with each other. Tom O’Regan’s desire to map interlocking systems of media, of technology, of institutions, of culture, was always geared towards an understanding of where points of intervention could best happen. I argue that his long-standing attachment to the writings of Michel Foucault and Bruno Latour did not just shape his research, but also his sense of his own role, responsibilities, and capacity to act in the service of others within the structures and networks of the contemporary Australian university. },

Implications for policy studies are discussed with regard to a recently liberated state that first, adopted Australian cultural policy precepts, and then closed them out 23 years later in response to the Rhodes Must Fall movement. Explanation is found not just in corruption and fallism, but in an inability to be outward-looking. The dialectical implications for policy studies are discussed. },

  abstract = {This short reflective piece revisits Tom O’Regan’s article “Some Reflections on the ‘Policy Moment’” from 1992. Tom’s intervention in the cultural policy debate which raged at that time was magisterial, wide ranging and inclusive. He saw the argument for policy to frame engaged scholarly activity as limiting the social relevance of the humanities and social sciences. Whereas the traditional ‘inclusive and abstract’ injunction to be relevant was fashioned in such a way as not to prescribe the form of engagement, the policy injunction limits relevance to what ‘can be made actionable, publicly endorsed, institutionally sanctioned and found useful by government tribunals, policy-makers and other actors directly involved in the policy process’. This narrowing, he argued, misrecognises the multifaceted nature of policy formation and debate. I reflect on how Tom’s position, and that of Meaghan Morris, has influenced me subsequently through a brief discussion of various scholarly personae that the engaged scholar can adopt. },

  abstract = {This article focuses upon the context within which much of Tom O’Regan’s early work took place, and which this work helped to frame. The importance of a particular formation of cultural nationalism to the beginnings of media and cultural studies in Australia is no longer front of mind for most of us today as we confront the challenges of a dramatically reconfigured transnational media landscape. However, it was particularly important to the development of these fields over the 1980s and 1990s. Initially most closely collected with the case being made for government support of the resurgent Australian film industry, it also became crucial to what was a distinctive field of concentration of work in Australian media studies: the link between a critical media studies and an interest in the formation of cultural policy in the national interest. The article discusses this tendency in, and its influence upon, Tom O’Regan’s pioneering contribution to Australian film, media and cultural studies, before turning to the more recent shifts that took place in his work as it went beyond cultural nationalism to engage with the emerging issues around the rise of the platform. },

Although O’Regan’s work is often described as being concerned primarily with social discourses and institutional contexts in the landscape of audiovisual media, he also paid close attention to the mechanisms of film and TV texts. His view of meaning was complex and multi-factorial, reflecting both his intellectual approach and his personal temperament. },

  abstract = {The paper addresses the implications for the contemporary academy of changes in the organization of journal editorship. Taking the example of cultural studies and the journal Continuum, it considers the shift from the intimate ‘artisanal’ mode in which many journals have had their origins to more impersonal alienated forms, organized through market or quasi-market relations. A common interpretation of this shift is that it has been driven by the interests of large commercial publishers, who have subordinated editing to the requirements of ‘academic capitalism’. In contrast to this, the paper suggests that the demise of the artisanal mode might be understood through A.O. Hirschman’s concept of ‘exit’. Market or quasi-market forms have not been imposed but rather chosen as a response to a situation in which alienation has already occurred. The perspective allows us to see editorial work ‘after exit’ not as passively driven by external forces, but as involving its own kinds of creative choices. For the case of Continuum, particular tribute is paid in this context to the editorial direction of Brian Shoesmith. },

It also discusses the impact of Brian and his research on the development of the Department of Communication in Airlangga University in Surabaya and to the transformation of television audience studies in the Indonesian context. I will examine Brian’s publications on satellite television in Asia and the account of the Australian Television International channel’s failure in Asia in the early 1990s. Taking my cue from Brian’s writings about the challenge of the Australian Television Int ernational channel in Asia, I will discuss the situation of national audiences in Indonesia and their attitude towards the persistence of imported/foreign programmes, including Australian television programmes. In fact, the consumption of Australian cultural productions in Indonesia continues to be problematic and less widespread compared to the more dominant Western (US) and Asian (Korean) productions. },

I discuss Brian’s work on Harold A. Innis and communications theory, his interests in Asian media and Indian cinema, the research agendas he forged at Edith Cowan University and his institution building efforts later in his career. In writing this piece, I am struck now by how rich this period was in Australian communications, media and cultural studies. In this respect, the article contributes to a broader collective account of a period that registers what we have lost in the metric obsessed academy of audit cultures, performance rankings and research excellence: a shared sense of intellectual adventure between academic staff and students, an institutional environment that conditioned disciplinary experimentation (or at least remained sufficiently oblivious to activities on its margins) and a general culture of living theory. Those days seem over. Yet, by reflecting on the many activities of Brian, together with his contemporaries like Tom O’Regan and many of their generation, we might recuperate a sense of the vibrancy of that time as a possible resource in negotiating an increasingly circumscribed institutional and disciplinary horizon of the present. },

This network of institutions including the United States Information Services (USIS) and the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) engaged in film diplomacy by influencing the government and ministries of Turkey to sponsor, produce, distribute and exhibit educational films. This study identifies key institutional agents and investigates how feedback-loops between institutions create asymmetrical power relations to shape culture, policy and public opinion through film technologies. This examination expands upon the existing historical knowledge about educational films by analyzing previously unexamined archival materials from the Turkish and American archives. },

Although this spike in scholarly attention has greatly advanced our understanding of reactance as a communication effect, its growing popularity has been accompanied by lack of conceptual and operational precision and agreement. This review characterizes the wide spectrum of approaches to defining, labeling, and examining reactance in communication research, summarizing major areas of variability. The overall landscape suggests that greater methodological consensus is needed, and there is opportunity to build on prior explications to hone the best approaches to measuring this phenomenon. Ideas for future research are offered to help guide (1) refinement and expansion of current prevailing methodologies, (2) development of measures appropriate to a broader range of communication contexts, and (3) use of more precise and consistent reactance terminology in the communication literature. },

This special edition marks the centenary of Raymond Williams’s birth in August 2021. It maps out some of his key work and considers how Williams’s thinking is both foundational for cultural studies – in its ‘bloodstream’ – and yet is now often overlooked, unattributed or unacknowledged. While Williams’s work was limited in the sense that it did not register or account for gender or race, and thus at times has been amenable to regressive interpretations, the essay also considers how his writing has provided theoretical models, political inspiration, and intellectual resources for feminism and anti-imperialism. It concludes by reflecting on the deep, enduring radicalness of his thinking, and argues that rather than disavow it for the silences, absences and limitations, we might continue to build upon, extend and pluralise what remains a rich, vital and urgent body of work. },

Combining Williams’ cultural materialist account of language with the practical orientation of Keywords, it sketches a way of developing the keywords approach as a method of sociocultural analysis. Drawing on some practical examples, it offers ‘keywords-as-method’ as a means of carrying out a historicist and materialist study of the relationship of linguistic to social change, that goes beyond the simple glossary of terms approach that has thus far limited the explanatory and critical potential of Keywords. In so doing, I hope to contribute to the renewal of Williamsian scholarship that has coincided with the centenary of his birth. },

  abstract = {This article narrates how I discovered cybernetics, who inspired me to make the contributions of which I am proud, and the ideas that led me to recognize the importance of understanding the social world we live in as a consequence of what we do in language. It took me some time before I recognized that circular causality and digitalization that made cybernetics the driver of the current revolution toward a computationally autonomous information society had serious limitations. When used to explain human involvements, the mathematics of cybernetics trivializes what we do to each other and blinds us to recognize how cybernetics transformed society. Studying conversations and discourses made me aware of how cybernetic vocabularies, guiding concepts, and computational metaphors were enacted. By contrast to (first- or second-order) cybernetics, I learned that a cybernetics that is practiced in conversations and acknowledges the social consequences of what it generates had to be reflexive. Shifting attention from causal circularities to reflexive circularities opens up huge new areas for exploring socially meaningful contributions and criticizing the epistemologies of mindless discursive practices (e,g., of claiming the superiority of artificial intelligence and the power of computers). Such claims merely entrap their believers into inaction. },

  abstract = { In this review study, a descriptive analysis was conducted of the media addiction research published from 1991 to 2016. The search of all academic output published in 13 major scientific and academic databases in 256 journals within the 26-year period yielded 1,099 Social Sciences Citation Index/Science Citation Index (SSCI/SCI) articles that were relevant to this study. The review was focused on the trends, developmental periods, study domains, themes, research methods, measurement instruments, and research purposes in the field of media addiction. The results show that most previous media addiction research in the study period were conducted from the perspectives of compulsivity and impairment. As a psychiatric disorder and a complex biopsychosocial phenomenon, the findings suggest that future media addiction research should go beyond the predominant perspectives in the prevalence, causes, and consequences of media addiction (59.7\%) and extend into the effectiveness of prevention and treatment (only 3.96\%) provided in both clinical and nonclinical settings. The review also shows that of the 974 studies using quantitative or mixed methods to examine media addiction, over 30\% used Young’s Internet Addiction Test and Diagnostic Questionnaire as the two frequently used measurement scales, which means that they were adopted by at least 20 studies in the study period. Furthermore, over 77\% of the media addiction studies employed survey and experiment methods. The implications of these findings for future media addiction research and the limitations of the study are discussed. },

  abstract = {French philosopher Bernard Stiegler inscribes himself in the tradition of critical theory. In this respect, the influence of Adorno and Horkheimer has been crucial to the development of his own understanding of cinema. Yet Stiegler reproaches his predecessors for not having stressed enough the positive virtues of cinema on culture. For Stiegler the industry of cinema is not simply a menace to the human mind, but a positive medium for its reinvention. It is in that sense that cinema is pharmacological, insofar as it can be either spiritually and culturally enhancing or destructive, depending on how it is acted on. As the article concludes, Stiegler's pharmacology of cinema invites us to take part in our cinematic cultural becoming through the revival of the figure of the amateur. But it does so at the risk of cultural snobbery. While Stiegler does not condemn the cinematic medium per se, he does express clear reservations on the potential of commercial cinema, the pharmacological critique of which remains to be thought.},

  abstract = {This article examines knowledge production in the sociology of music. Focusing on the idea of cool music, we interrogate the nature of music researchers' relationship with their object of research. While the qualification and connotation of cool is widespread in popular music, sociology has largely neglected to engage with it as an object of research. Instead, the sociological investigation of music audiences is divided between two opposed but co-constructed paradigms that ultimately do not account for how cool emerges as a qualifier and connotation, how it performs as a discourse on music, and to what effect. Using the example of aging music researchers as a departure point, we examine how the cool connotations of music function as a mode of discourse that legitimates particular knowledge, practice, and taste, demarcating insider/outsider status. We explore how music acquires social connotations such as “cool” and whether that alters music researchers' approaches to it. We argue that apart from the disclosure of inclinations, social characteristics, and relationships to the object of research (music scenes, preferences, fandom, and so on), the tradition of reflexive empirical perspectives in music sociology should incorporate further deconstruction of the transformative dimensions in the relations between music and researcher. Music, as a complex and dynamic object, thus, requires sociology to produce accounts that both encompass people's enjoyment and experience as well as its boundary-defining capacity.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes a feminist critique of the media and communication field by offering a different soundtrack to guide future historical research. By shifting the focus from well-known protagonists, and acknowledging process and community rather than individuals, we aim to amplify ‘hidden’ domains of gendered labour and layers of media technologies and services. We propose the ‘listening in’ model as a different way to engage with histories of media and communication, providing four pathways for how the histories of film, radio and internet in particular have been theorised and researched. These pathways focus on multiplicities of expertise, layers of infrastructure, users, and the media canon. For the first pathway, we show how media production has always been a collective work of multiple expertise. The second pathway breaks with the distinction between media and communication and emphasises reciprocal processes of media production. For the third, we demonstrate how media theory and research have tended to assume specific ideal bodies while ignoring others. For the final pathway, we propose a rethinking of how media histories and theories are narrated via the usual protagonists and call for a new canon to achieve a richer and more nuanced understanding within the field. },

@phdthesis{jones2016paul,
  abstract = {This thesis explores a previously neglected period in American public broadcasting history, that of the early- to mid-1950s. Engelman (1996) has described the 1950s as 'The Foundation Years', a time in which large philanthropic foundations - most prominently the Ford Foundation - invested in non-commercial broadcasting. While the importance of the Ford Foundation to the development of public broadcasting has been noted in the literature, it has never been explored in any detail. Where it is discussed, the focus tends to be on the practical support that the foundation offered, funding the production and distribution of programmes. My focus is not on the practical support offered by the Ford Foundation, but rather on the contribution that the foundation attempted to make to the philosophical debate regarding the place of broadcasting in American public life. I argue that the Ford Foundation intended, in the early 1950s, to breathe new life into the media reform movement that had been advancing the cause of public broadcasting throughout the 1930s and 1940s. Following the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) 1952 decision to reserve a portion of the broadcast spectrum for educational television, and at the behest of Robert M Hutchins, the Ford Foundation established a Television Advisory Committee (TAC). The purpose of the TAC was to undertake a wide-ranging, critical review of the place of television in American society, similar to that undertaken by Hutchins' own Commission on the Freedom of the Press. One of America's preeminent media scholars, Paul F Lazarsfeld, was appointed to Chair the TAC, yet its original aims would never be realised. In this thesis, I argue that Lazarsfeld himself was largely to blame for impeding the work of the TAC, to the long-term detriment of American public media.},

Luego regresa a Argentina y finalmente en México, tras los forzados exilios que iban imponiendo las dictaduras del Cono Sur. Para abordar su trayectoria realizamos un meta-análisis de sus producciones académicas, identificamos cambios, rupturas y continuidades en sus temas de investigación y posiciones teóricas. Leímos sus contribuciones en el cuadro de los desplazamientos que recogen las historias del campo de la comunicación en Latinoamérica: desde la etapa de autonomización (en los años sesenta y setenta) a la de institucionalización (en los años ochenta), de profesionalización (en los noventa) y de burocratización y consolidación académica (desde los 2000). Los principales resultados y conclusiones del artículo se sintetizan en cierta recuperación de las tradiciones críticas de los años ´70 en sus trabajos de los ´90.},

  abstract = {Investigaciones recientes con perspectiva de género han confirmado la pervivencia del \"Efecto Matilda\" en la ciencia, haciendo que las aportaciones y el papel de las mujeres sigan quedando relegados dentro de sus comunidades científicas. En este contexto, la propuesta que ocupa estas páginas se centra en comprobar si el fenómeno también se produce en la comunidad hispanoamericana de investigación en Comunicación, realizando para ello un análisis sociométrico sobre la red de coautorías. Los resultados señalan que pese a que tres de los cinco puestos más centrales de la red están ocupados por féminas, en términos generales se registran diferencias significativas que desplazan a las investigadoras a posiciones más periféricas. Del mismo modo, se ha detectado que las comunidades de investigación formadas por los distintos clústeres tienden a estar organizadas en torno a varones, confirmando así la presencia del Matilda effect en la red social de la disciplina de Comunicación. Cabe señalar que estas conclusiones se extrapolan a unos parámetros intelectuales (Comunicación) y geográficos (España y Latinoamérica) concretos, por lo que la puerta a estudios en otros ámbitos queda abierta.},

  abstract = {The paper compares the lives of three female social scientists born in the first two decades of the twentieth century and belonging to the first generations that had the opportunity not only to study at universities, but also to realistically consider a professional career in academia. Marie Jahoda, Herta Herzog and Patricia L. Kendall made their ways separately and interacted only rarely with each other, but shared at least one characteristic which influenced their careers: they were married to Paul F. Lazarsfeld, one of the eminent sociologists of the twentieth century, prominent as someone who encouraged and supported many of his collaborators and students. The comparison of these three women shows that they were professionally successful but did not completely prioritize academic work before other interests, ambitions, and obligations. These priorities found a correspondence in their underperformance in academia with regard to the particular preconditions to enter the pantheon of an academic discipline. Both their oeuvres and their academic records suggest that they were not actively striving to become academic ‘immortals.’ Here it is shown that women, even if they are to be located below the ‘ultra elite,’ produced remarkable and memorable intellectual achievements. },

@article{Kursell_2021,
  abstract = {Presenting the joint historical and methodological framework of the theme issue “Sounds of Language—Languages of Sound,” this introduction situates the individual contributions within a broader history of the humanities. The eight contributions address the period between approximately 1890 and 1970—from the modern disciplinary formation of knowledge about sound and the rise of the social sciences and humanities to the beginnings of computerized sound research. During this period, disciplines as diverse as linguistics, musicology, history, sociology, law, and theology all aspired to give scholarly attention to sound, and in particular to the spoken word. Starting from the observation that late nineteenth-century scholars of language turned from expert readers of historical texts into expert listeners to living languages, we trace the dual use of language as an object and a tool of knowledge production. As a research theme, language often broke through frontiers between the humanities, the social sciences, and the natural sciences, as well as between academic and nonacademic domains of knowledge. At the same time, new languages and modes of speaking arose as tools to examine, represent, and utilize sonic phenomena—whether in speech, music, or other sonic environments. The theme issue’s three claims are, first, that sound both enabled and necessitated new alliances between otherwise divergent fields of knowledge; second, that sound and language motivated humanities scholars to reconsider or even reinvent their methodologies; and, third, that research on sound and language was deeply permeated by issues of power and politics.},

  abstract = {In the 1920s, the emerging technology of radio required appropriate voices, whether in radio announcing, radio drama, or radio documentaries. This article traces this search for new radio voices with particular attention to the work conducted at the radio laboratory, the Rundfunkversuchsstelle, at the Academy of Music in Berlin, led by musicologist Georg Schünemann from 1928 to 1935. The article illuminates how this initiative integrated engineering and the humanities into new forms of laboratory research on speech and broadcasting technology. With its explicitly application-oriented agenda, the Berlin lab prompted the phoneticians, linguists, psychologists, musicologists, and language educators involved to reconsider their humanistic methods and spheres of social influence. I follow the trail that leads from these early forms of research in the “applied humanities,” taking shape in Berlin during the Weimar Republic with its increasingly politicized radio studies, to Vienna in the late 1930s, and thence across the Atlantic to the Office of Radio Research at Princeton. There, research on the “voice of radio” (Theodor W. Adorno) took new directions and engaged, once again, in a fundamental debate over what applied research means to the humanities and social sciences.},

  abstract = {In influential strains of late twentieth-century US legal discourse on free speech, speech and language have been disconnected from sound, and speech rendered as a form of writing. The effect of this is a free speech jurisprudence in which analysis of speech is less concerned with speakers and more concerned with messages. The article explores this situation by examining the legal reasoning in a 2001 case in which federal district court judges ruled that computer programs written in binary computer code (1s and 0s) were a form of “speech” covered by the First Amendment. They did so by equating speech with writing, drawing on a theorization of language in terms of information rather than as embodied social practice. The article argues that this logic follows the popularization of information theory and the rhetoric of disembodiment that grew out of this popularization in the latter half of the twentieth century.},

Two sessions were conducted with Dervin that covered scholarly and biographical topics. The interviews reveal aspects of Dervin’s personal journey as a researcher, and a teacher, and provide insight into how she saw the related fields of information science and communication developing shared interests and shared perspectives in social research. Dervin candidly shares how her life experiences, both inside and outside of academia, have influenced the development of her theoretical approach. Readers will find here discussion of a range of issues associated with the Sense-Making Methodology as well as Dervin’s thoughts on how information and communication domains intersect within the context of modern digital environments. With reference to her own experiences, Dervin outlines how important it is to ensure that leadership within complex online environments is fostered in the areas of public information provision, and in civic dialogue, and how managing the information frameworks within which critical inquiry can thrive requires increasing commitment to, and understanding of, the human-centered considerations surrounding interpretation and identity.

During that period, suggestion theory was one of the foremost psychological explanations of opinion change and a dominant theory of media influence. Despite its long prominence in early social science and media studies, the doctrine has been largely ignored in contemporary histories of mass communication research. Although writers debate the origins and nature of early media effects scholarship, few of the contending parties address the role of the suggestion doctrine, and those who do offer but a passing reference.

Drawing comparisons to the Propaganda Analysis research paradigm of the Interwar years, this essay and issue call attention to historical similarities between patterns in mass communication research then and now. The hope is that contemporary misinformation studies scholars can learn from and avoid the pitfalls that have historically faced propaganda researchers. Placing research on propaganda in historical context offers one way of counterbalancing the depoliticizing tendencies that can be found in contemporary misinformation studies. It provides a wider field of vision, and calls attention to the contingency of the very concepts that social scientists use to frame their surveys and interviews, code their content, and ground their analysis.},

  abstract = {Walter Benjamin is today regarded as one of the leading thinkers of the twentieth century. Often captured in pensive pose, his image is now that of a serious intellectual. But Benjamin was also a fan of the comedies of Adolphe Menjou, Mickey Mouse, and Charlie Chaplin. As an antidote to repressive civilization, he developed, through these figures, a theory of laughter. Walter Benjamin and the Aesthetics of Film is the first monograph to thoroughly analyse Benjamin's film writings, contextualizing them within his oeuvre whilst also paying attention to the various films, actors, and directors that sparked his interest. The book situates all these writings with Benjamin's 'anthropological materialism', a concept that analyses the transformations of the human sensorium through technology. Through the term 'innervation', Benjamin thought of film spectatorship as an empowering reception that, through a rush of energy, would form a collective body within the audience, interpenetrating a liberated technology into the distracted spectators. Benjamin's writings on Soviet film and German cinema, Charlie Chaplin, and Mickey Mouse are analysed in relation to this posthuman constellation that Benjamin had started to dream of in the early twenties, long before he started to theorize about films.},

These companies, facing scrutiny from regulators and critics, have a stake in their portrayal. This essay recounts a pair of episodes in early radio research, as a cautionary tale. The Princeton Radio Research Project, the leading U.S. media research program of the 1930s, had multiple ties to the radio industry. The project’s leadership, and its main philanthropic sponsor, were keen to maintain good relations with the networks. A pair of critical researchers, James Rorty and Theodor Adorno, violated the project’s de facto ban on scrutinizing radio’s commercial underpinnings. They were both dismissed. Could ongoing access to data, and the prospect of future funding, lead today’s researchers—and even other, non-corporate patrons—to conclude that certain questions are too incendiary to pose?},

Early in his career, Postman promoted a pedagogy of teaching and learning about language, media, and culture. In defining propaganda as “a most mischievous word,” Postman aimed to heighten learners’ attention on the abstracting function of language and its capacity to reshape attitudes, beliefs, and knowledge. },

This article examines the rhetoric, practices, and collaborative professional efforts of two of the most significant institutions conducting opinion research in West Germany in the 1950s: the Allensbach Institute and the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt. Although the political stances of these institutions differed, they were motivated to apply empirical research methods associated with Anglo-American social research to the West German population by shared concerns about the fragility of democracy, faith in the empirical sciences as an antidote to Nazi-era thought patterns, and the need to form a united front against doubters within West Germany. Even while declaring their desire to incorporate the latest empirical advances from the United States, however, they sought to articulate the meaning of their methods and findings in terms of the specific challenges faced by West Germany.},

  abstract = {This manuscript highlights Michèle Mattelart’s contributions in the context of the intellectual history of communication studies in Latin America since genealogies in this field have underestimated the role and importance of female researchers. The methodological approach aims to create memories and build a path that goes through the intellectual biography and history of communication studies from a feminist point of view that maintains its subjective and situated dimension. By considering such aspects, key moments in Michèle’s intellectual trajectory – 1960s/1970s – are described, especially the ones focused on the links between communication and gender studies, which she was a pioneer in Latin America},

  abstract = {The notion of communication-world condenses the intellectual project that Armand Mattelart conceived in France towards the end of the 1980s and that was later developed with creativity and determination in the following decade. This notion is introduced and developed in his trilogy: Mapping World Communication (Mattelart, 1992/2003); The Invention of Communication (Mattelart, 1994/1995); Histoire de l’utopie planétarie (Mattelart, 1999/2000). Since the mid-1980s France saw the spread of a discourse that believed that communication can explain the social; placing Mattelart’s theoretical contribution in this context will allow us to account not only for the conditions that fostered his ideas, but also for their singularity and productivity to understand contemporary social organization through a critique of culture and communication.},

Therefore, the time is ripe to contextualise the formative years of the Association and its wider impact on the study of media history internationally, and to reflect on the organisational history of IAMHIST through the analysis of primary source materials and interviews with its members in order to highlight the importance of cataloguing, archiving and digitising IAMHIST’s own history. },

Anticipating the widespread use of network in the humanities today, Kenner adapts the term from Marshall McLuhan and uses it throughout the 1950s and ’60s to think about intellectual networks, little magazines, and academic communication. The network concept is also considered in light of Kenner’s political conservatism and his participation in the midcentury movement of conservatism. },

  abstract = {The documentary series Ways of Seeing was broadcast on BBC television in January 1972. Directed by Mike Dibb and presented by the marxist critic John Berger, the series addressed the canon of western art history as well as contemporary consumer culture. The conspicuous use of cross-cutting and music along with Berger’s emphatic ‘talking-head’ delivery were employed to dispel the aura enveloping ‘original’ artworks, and reveal the technologies by which art historians, curators and advertising agencies shored up a capitalist, western, male social order. The series and its associated book were canonical for the nascent disciplines of media and culture studies. Drawing on scripts and other materials from the BBC, Berger and Dibb archives, this essay explains how the four episodes were conceived and executed. It places the series in the context of Berger’s prior activity as artist, art critic, presenter and author, noting the influence of Frederick Antal, Walter Benjamin and others. It concludes that Berger’s charisma and the mastery of the relatively new technology of colour television displayed by the series undermined its intent: rather than encouraging viewers to use images in framing their own personal narratives, its message was consumed as an invitation to view all images in political terms.},

To understand the current state of Arab media scholarship, the article explores the various influences that have played a decisive role in determining the quality and quantity of research productivity. Factors such as the Arab countries’ historical roots, traditional societies, patterns in education, and current conflicts in the region are shown to have an impact on Arab scholars’ engagement with research. To aid the advancement of theory of Arab media research, this essay advocates for conducting collaborative research and proposes a hybrid approach that merges epistemologies in a culture-sensitive, empirical manner that is capable of making universal generalizations while staying true to the specificities of the region itself. },

  abstractnote = {&lt;p&gt;As a means of understanding the identity and heritage of organizational communication scholarship, we conducted a content analysis of 1,399 articles published in communication journals since 1964. Our findings demonstrate key turning points in organizational communication scholarship, trends in the development of knowledge, and areas in which this subfield can continue to grow in future endeavors.  While research has problematized power and has emphasized the constitutive nature of communication, more research is needed to explore alternative forms of organizing and to expand diversity scholarship beyond gender and nationality.  While research has grown more theoretically complex, work can still be done developing meso-level theories that highlight the role of communication in various organizing processes.  While qualitative methods have erased the dominance of quantitative methods, greater parity and an appreciation for how methods may inform each other would advance scholarly contributions.  While the number of studies conducted in organizations has grown, the percentage of studies using field work methods has declined, increasing the risk that research may miss important contextual cues.  We discuss the implications of these findings as a road map for new scholars wanting to understand what organizational communication has been and all scholars wanting to know what organizational communication can be.&lt;/p&gt;},

  abstract = {Research on discourses and communication processes around and from within LGBTQ communities is an effervescent field of study in the Anglo- Saxon world, a field originated in the 1980s and led by the United States. However, this vibrancy cannot be extrapolated to the Spanish-speaking Ibero-American countries (constituted by Latin America and Spain), where this area, only budding, is epistemologically barren. This article analyzes the identity and main trends of the LGBTQ studies in Hispanophone countries, following a Delphi consultation study with experts from Colombia, México, Perú, and Spain. The results show some of the main current trends and suggest strategies to boost these studies in Ibero-America. As proposed in the Conclusions section, the type of research that we develop in this article is of crucial importance to increase the visibility of sexual minorities in Spanish-speaking societies, giving them voice and thus restoring human dignity.},

  abstract = {{With the explosive growth in research topics, communication science is said to be more fragmented and hyper-specialized than ever before, producing an increasing number of small, niche research topics that lack intellectual coherence as a whole. While such issues have been a central concern for the field, there has been a relative lack of systematic effort to map the topical interconnections among different communication science subfields, answering the question of how they remain empirically fragmented. Using full-texts of scholarly articles published in the top 20 communication science journals from 2010 to 2019, we provide systematic evidence to such claims in terms of their actual contents and their connectivity patterns. Drawing on extant works concerning the sociology of science and structures of scientific knowledge, as well as on topic modeling and simulation-based inferences on network topological features, we find that subdisciplinary linkage in communication is more frequent than we often think.}},

  abstract = {American mathematicians' contributions to the engineering and production of equipment in World War II included the exploration of ways to improve choices between competing designs and maximize the value of experimental testing of prototypes. After the war, these contributions were extended, particularly at the RAND Corporation. Working on such matters, Kenneth Arrow took a keen interest in testing as a paradigm for information gathering in economic decision-making and in encouraging investment in R&D as an information-gathering exercise essential to making informed choices in military systems acquisition. He later extended insights about the shortcomings of information gathering as a market activity to his touchstone analysis of disparities of information between physician and patient as a crucial aspect of the economics of medical care. While it is difficult to trace the precise influence of the work of Arrow and others around him on engineering and R&D management, the issues they grappled with have remained relevant for more than half a century.},

Here, comprehending the notion of the West is considered significant, as it offers a model of comparison. While it is not necessary for the perspectives and process to be radical, it should be convincing to grasp Asia as a formation of a changeable force to the West. Of course, media scholars have to avoid limited perspectives emphasizing only intra-Asian dialogues; instead they must analyze Asian perspectives in the globalization context. What non-Western scholars must contemplate are not only paradigms that are unique to Asian society but also general trends and norms that apply to the globe so that they can identify new trends and directions, which provide fundamentals to advance new theories and norms in global media studies. This certainly contributes to a broadening of media theory and comprehension in a way that takes account of the practices of non-Western countries outside the Anglo-American sphere. },

  abstract = {In this article, I reflect on the theoretical rise of the public sphere in the 1990s from the vantage point of South Korea, connecting this approach to the broader context of the global post–Cold War transition. The case of South Korea – a postcolonial, authoritarian country with deep geopolitical connections to the West – offers a node of the global embrace of the public sphere in the 1990s for theorizing the transformation of authoritarian countries into liberal capitalist democracies, elevating the distinction between state and civil society as a prominent focus. However, the establishment of authoritarian public spheres in Asia and the illiberal turn of public spheres in the Global North in the 2010s call upon scholars to identify relevant questions regarding current public spheres while addressing what essential components define the public sphere. Here, I call for critical attention to the loci of power and oppression, to the production of critical practices within a particular social configuration, and to coexistence within a civil society. I end the article by proposing a set of suggestions for reading, theorizing, and teaching public sphere theories. },

It specifically implies a decentring of the discipline of art history towards the interdisciplinary study of sociocultural visibilities. This paper deals with the development of this research field in an intellectual climate still characterised by the ‘Culture Wars’ engaged in by the neoconservatives against certain areas of the academy and the artistic world during the 1980s. By taking into account the struggles about Visual Studies inside the intellectual Left as an integral part of their definition, this paper analyses the academic politicisations of the notions of ‘Visual Culture’ (culture visuelle) and ‘Visual Studies’ (études visuelles) in the context of the current French importation and redefinition of these categories. },

  abstract = { The late twentieth century visual turn established the study of visual culture as central to the humanities and social sciences. Yet there is no consensus over the scope of the field that has come to be known as visual studies. This article offers a dialectical account in response. It finds a precedent in two dialectical models that have been prominent in visual studies, namely those of Walter Benjamin and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. It argues that the work of Merleau-Ponty offers the better model for a contemporary dialectic because it is not tied to a particular ideological position. Merleau-Ponty’s work can be used to ground a dialectic of visual culture which begins with the eye and has as its three main moments the life-world, representation, and technology. Each of these three moments is explored in turn in order to demonstrate that this is a genuine dialectic in the sense that the final stage returns to the initial position but leaves it thoroughly transformed. The advantage of this approach is that it yields, for the first time, an account of the study of visual culture that does not rely on ideological or methodological principles to explain the range of the field. },

  abstract = {Widespread concerns about new technologies—whether they be novels, radios, or smartphones—are repeatedly found throughout history. Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology’s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies. },

It interrogates how Lewis's initial ambivalence towards an emergent technological society shifted through direct encounters with mechanized warfare, and speculates on the effect of these upon his post-war writing and criticism. By contrasting Lewis's thought against that of his Italian Futurist contemporaries, I will demonstrate the centrality of their divergent conceptions of masculinity in accounting for this opposition – and how Lewis's critique of technological society prefigures contemporary opposition towards the post-humanist philosophy of Accelerationism. },

  abstract = {Caillois’s classic text Man, Play and Games leaves open a basic question: Why focus on four specific kinds of play? Subsequent authors have offered their own rationalizations and expanded upon his game categories but have not explained Caillois’s approach. This essay performs a close reading of Man, Play and Games in order to evince his methodology. I argue that Caillois holds to the idea that play reproduces uncertainty in a safe and confined way but that a paradox troubles this vision and pushes him into a baroque formalism. Instead of a simple relation between model and copy, Caillois develops another, stranger concept of mimesis that continues and extends his Surrealist writing about insects and the unconscious. My reading builds on previous analyses of Caillois within game studies, sociology, and media theory to revise the methodological presuppositions built into the categorization of games. },

  abstract = {Our goal in this article is to understand the historical sequences as well as consequences of the internet on the development of the academic field of communication. As a field that has one foot in the study of a most basic and necessary human activity, and another foot in the study of innovative technology, has scholarship in the field of communication followed internet developments? Is there a lag between technological developments and communication research focused on those developments? We attempt to answer our questions by searching for keywords (such as computer, internet, CMC, etc.) in content from communication journals from 1970 to 2000. We find that a large number of keywords were entirely absent, and many of the occurrences involved the same small number of terms, indicative of a relatively narrow and/or shallow amount of interest in these phenomena. The dominance of terms like ‘computer’ and ‘internet’ (and, eventually, ‘Web’) indicate a generalist tone at work in these articles. There is relatively little breadth in the vocabulary related to computers and the internet, suggesting that the field of communication that was seemingly trying to digest the entire (constructed) category of behavior associated with computers and the internet in one gigantic linguistic bite rather than focusing on activities taking place via this new medium. There was not yet a sense of meaningful differentiation in what internet-based communication could involve; ‘internet’ communication was simply communication occurring by means of an internet-based delivery system; a new medium, figuratively and literally. },

Convinced that the report was “part of a plot” to destroy the First Amendment, McCormick underwrote a 642-page rebuttal, Prejudice and the Press: A Restatement of the Principle of Freedom of the Press with Specific Reference to the Hutchins-Luce Commission, by Tribune reporter Frank Hughes. The story behind Prejudice and the Press represents an unknown chapter in the midcentury battle between conservative publishers and liberal press critics.

  abstract = {This article investigates the entangled history of the propaganda battles waged during World War II, focusing on Germany, the Soviet Union, and the United States. It asks how and to what extent these three political regimes conceptualized propaganda as a knowledge-based practice and what kind of expertise they mobilized. Although American propaganda strategists were the only ones to make use of modern social science methods as part of their activities, under the difficult circumstances of ongoing war operations, the practices of knowledge production by military intelligence did not fundamentally differ between the three countries. The war profoundly changed the way knowledge was systematically mobilized for political and military purposes, and transnational entanglements, perceptions, and observations (but also misperceptions and projections) played a crucial role in that development. This directly connects World War II developments to the emergence of a Cold War regime of producing and using scientific knowledge for strategic purposes. },

  abstract = {For more than a century—dating as far back as 1907, when the first German-language film publications were initially established—Filmkritik (criticism, historiography, all manner of cultural discourse on cinema) has been a prized form of expression, a thriving intellectual, journalistic, and professional enterprise. More limited in scope at the start, it quickly blossomed during the Wilhelmine and Habsburg Empires, through the interwar and postwar periods, and into the twenty-first century. Over the years it has faced numerous challenges: the political rifts of the twentieth century (including the Third Reich and the East-West divide), the technological shifts of the medium and the modes of writing about it (from silent to sound pictures, print to digital), the exigencies of archival initiatives and film preservation. At the same time, from its beginnings Filmkritik has been a relentlessly international affair, traversing national borders and transcending the limits of language and origin. Moreover, Filmkritik has persistently crossed the Atlantic due not only to the migration of prominent critics and filmmakers themselves but to the receptive audiences and readerships on both sides.},

This article looks at “short form” criticism in edited volumes and emerging journals that worked to establish this cinema’s coherence and prestige. The virtuous cycle inaugurated in the 1990s—when critics wrote with great acuity about recent films, and filmmakers seemed to work to meet heightened expectations—has continued with full-length monographs for a wider audience in the new millennium. This development, however, has not been without its detractors. Specifically, Michael Haneke’s Caché (2005) can be interpreted as an ambivalent statement about the power of the critic.},

The symptomatic impetus that had figured so strongly during the postwar era gave way to the so-called new subjectivism of young critics like Michael Althen, Claudius Seidl, and Andreas Kilb. They looked askance at the formal complexity and political activism of most art house fare and above all found themselves smitten by mainstream American features. Taking their cue from Susan Sontag and her essay “Against Interpretation,” these postmodern existentialists cultivated a highly personalized, indeed rarefied form of poetic empiricism. This study analyzes their sensibility and rhetoric, their emphases and oversights. It focuses on Dominik Graf’s essay film, Was heißt hier Ende? (Then Is It the End?, 2015), a tribute to Althen and the cohort of young critics with whom he worked and interacted.},

First, it includes reviews of several films that have entered the canon of world cinema (The Last Laugh, The Blue Angel, The Man with the Movie Camera, Girls in Uniform). Second, it reflects Kracauer’s attraction, particularly during the early 1920s, to American slapstick.},

Our findings describe comparative studies of Internet use as an increasingly diverse topic in terms of its widespread publication outlets across different (sub)fields in communication studies, along with emerging dimensions of comparison. Meanwhile, conventional pitfalls and limits remain, including the easily ignored consideration and justification of equivalence and comparability in the research object and the analytical method, as well as the remaining dominant cross-territorial perspective and quantitative methods. We offer corresponding proposals to overcome pitfalls and advance future comparative studies of Internet use and, in a broader sense, comparative communication research.},

  abstract = {This article outlines the development of the history of the book not only as an academic discipline in its own right but as a field of study of critical, potentially central, importance for the advancement of the humanities in general. The history of the book helps revise the earlier relative marginalisation of cultural vis-à-vis political history. The publication in 1958 of L’apparition du livre by Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin has been followed by a series of multivolume, multi-authored national histories of the book and libraries, first in France, then in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. The history of book is having considerable influence in many areas of historical investigation, such as general history, literary history, the history of science and the history of religion. With the ‘Digital Revolution’, the history of the book is now converging with studies of the other media and, together with the growth of postcolonial/post-imperial studies in general, offers the prospect of a balanced and nuanced approach within the global academy to understanding the world’s media past, present and future. },

  abstract = {This article argues that in the development of media studies and cultural studies, a gap opened between textual analysis and political economy that became a damaging schism. The roots of the schism between the economic and the cultural lie in the growing influence of French structuralism, and post-structuralism from the late 1960s onwards. Jim McGuigan’s book, Cultural Populism, appeared at a time when socialist politics, political analysis and cultural theory were, both together and separately, in a degree of flux, self-reflection and loss of direction. This article outlines the nature of the split between emphasis on the cultural and the economic, the ways in which it continues to mark the field and the importance of continuing to try and hold the two together in the analytic frame. Methodologically, this article involves analysis of Cultural Populism and utilises document and archive searching, interviews, syllabus analysis and personal communication. },

I deepen this argument by outlining the history of ‘popular education’ in Europe and beyond in the modern period to illustrate how the coming together of subaltern political movements and intellectual inquiry created an independent public sphere of radical self-enlightenment. In this article, by utilising archival and textual sources, I should like to explore whether it may be possible to renew the original project of Cultural Studies through radical programmes of ‘popular’ adult education in the digital age. I see Jim McGuigan’s work as offering ‘resources of hope’, in Raymond Williams’ phrase, for this tradition in the universe of academic Cultural Studies. },

There is, however, an arena of British cultural studies that has always been concerned with ‘sentiment’ and that is the romance narrative. This article argues that the study of popular fictions has always been integral to the history of cultural studies, and that it established a site in which feminist voices would make gender politics intrinsic to the field. At a time when gender was not a central issue for either Literature or Cultural Studies, generic fictions written by and for women provided a site for research that was undeniably about female experience, and the analysis of those texts offered a strategy for asserting a feminist focus. },

  abstract = {This article unpacks the concept of ‘cultural populism’ in multiple ways, and explores its value for the critical analysis of new formations and expressions of populism in the current conjuncture. Taking Jim McGuigan’s influential book, Cultural Populism, as our point of departure, we begin by exploring its earlier use in cultural studies as a critical term for apolitical/celebratory modes of analysis, and then argue it may be usefully extended today to refer to popular and political efforts to construct a ‘people’ in overtly cultural terms. Second, we make the case for renewing an expressly ‘critical populist’ stance, one that is attentive to ordinary tastes and pleasures, while also locating and analysing them in relation to the production of needs and desires within a capitalist political economy, and that is attuned to the political possibilities for change. Third, we argue that the resources of cultural studies should be mobilised to redress some of the deficiencies of dominant accounts of populism from political science, and suggest that the twin concepts of cultural and critical populism offer an advance over the elitist and culturally reductive mode of analysis associated with Inglehart and Norris’ conception of ‘cultural backlash’. We conclude by offering an overview of the other contributions to the special issue, as they seek to push the concept of cultural populism in new directions, while also critically engaging with residual, dominant and emergent popular and populist currents in these new populist times. },

  abstract = {As Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney for over 20 years (1978–2001), György Márkus exerted a profound influence on a generation of philosophers and students from many disciplinary backgrounds. His legendary lecture courses, spanning the history of modern philosophy from the Enlightenment through to the late 20th century, were memorable for their breadth, erudition, and philosophical drama. Always modest despite his mastery of the tradition, Márkus’s approach to this history of philosophy never failed to emphasize its continuing role in shaping our inherited understanding of philosophy as ‘its own time comprehended in thoughts’ (Hegel). This is especially true of his contribution to the philosophical discourse of modernity, which we could summarize as comprising an original philosophy of cultural modernity. In what follows, I briefly reconstruct Márkus’s account of the adventures of the concept of culture, focusing on his definitive essay ‘The Path of Culture: From the Refined to the High, From the Popular to Mass Culture’ (2013) but also referring to other relevant Márkus texts, offering some critical remarks on his account of culture and its relationship with modern aesthetics, both classical and contemporary. },

AS PART OF THIS RETROSPECTIVE, WE ALSO REPRINT THE ORIGINAL 1971 ARTICLE “DEVELOPMENT COMMUNICATION IN THE AGRICULTURAL CONTEXT” BY NORA QUEBRAL, WITH A NEW FOREWORD BY HER.  How did the discipline and practice of development communication begin? Who were the founders and how were the first experiments implemented? Rejecting the ideologically populist views that locates development communication origins within western development scholarship, the following postcolonist exposé appraises various communication uses in development that emerged from different parts of the world in the past 50 years. The discussion holds that the pioneering development communication experiments were located between postcolonial and underdevelopment theories, and as such, to understand its origins, a study must focus on the earliest non-commissioned and community-originated experiments, as this study purports to do. },

  abstract = {This article outlines the emergence of Husserl’s theory of ‘communication proper’ (Mitteilung or Kommunikation) in the context of his genetic analyses of intersubjectivity. It defines the meaning and function of Mitteilung in contradistinction with the notion of empathy and thus demonstrates its distinct generative constitution. I propose that Mitteilung has the capacity to cancel the ‘operative’ opposition between social acts and instinctive intersubjectivity and thus to frame a non-determinist theory of sociality. This capacity is largely ignored by the dominant interpretation, according to which the concept of communication in Husserl is derivative of the more fundamental category of empathy. A major consequence to this argument is that it determines why eminent readers of Husserl such as Derrida have missed an important opportunity when they failed to notice the distinct role of Mitteilung. This alternative view is expanded onto communication media in general by taking Kittler’s project as a vantage point. },

  abstract = {This article reanimates the Adorno–Benjamin debate to investigate the potential of contemporary technologised consumer culture to become a space for bottom-up political agency and resistance. For both Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, the technological advancement of the 20th century had an inherently irrational character, as evidenced by the self-destructive tendencies of humanity during the Second World War. Nonetheless, the thinkers famously disagreed when it came to the implications of the marriage between technology and mass culture. Discerning its potential for the mobilisation of the masses, Benjamin believed that technology would politicise mass culture, allowing society to employ it for its political ends – an idea which Adorno debunked. Technologised consumer culture has noticeably evolved since the time of the debate. Nevertheless, revisiting the debate is necessary to understand a contradiction between the expanded possibilities for political participation and the return of the ‘auratic’ or cultic function of technologised consumer culture. At the same time, the article shows that technology does politicise consumer culture. However, the pitfall lies in that the politicisation is done through technology as a tool, which is vulnerable to appropriation, granting those who are in the position to control it a substantial political resource. Consequently, the article argues that the politicisation of consumer culture risks having a reverse effect of facilitating the aestheticising of politics – turning politics into a spectacle. },

  abstract = {Concerns about selective exposure and disinformation in the digital news environment have brought the concept of news diversity to the forefront of academic debates. Despite its growing prominence in scholarly work, however, news diversity often remains hard to grasp. The current paper aims to re-assess what the concept of news diversity means in an evolving news ecology. To do so, we draw on three dominant conceptualizations of news and media diversity. We use their strengths to unravel the variety in conceptualizations of news diversity and to explain how diversity is built on different conceptual and normative assumptions towards news media and democracy. Based on these insights, we perform a systematic literature review in which we map the current communication science literature that address news diversity. Results show that 43 different news diversity dimensions have been used in literature, indicating a form of academic cherry-picking with both normative and conceptual implications. We propose a way forward by formulating recommendations for future diversity research. This includes a shift to a more theoretically grounded approach in conceptualizing news diversity, a call for interdisciplinary research, and giving the idea of normativity a more pronounced place in research on news diversity. },

  abstract = {Since its inception, the internet has been as much technological as social, practical as ideological in character. This article examines academic discourse and asks how research on the multifaceted internet has evolved over the past 25 years. In order to investigate the formation of this academic field, we collected articles published in major academic journals dedicated to new media and digital communication as well as mainstream periodicals in communication studies over the past quarter of a century. Relying on a combination of (semi)automated content analysis and citation analysis, we find that articles related to the internet and its manifold aspects are cited more often than research on other topics. The literature review suggests that as the socio-material infrastructure of the internet has become deeply enmeshed in society its study has evolved from a niche pursuit to the discipline’s core area of inquiry. },

  abstract = {The Ford Foundation and the International Press Institute used an African journalism education partnership in the 1960s to recast Western influence, help develop new nations, create networks, forestall the Soviets and spread the norms of modern Western journalism in the anglophone countries of a newly free continent. Most of the 300 Africans who graduated the African Training Scheme’s six-month-long course already were working at newspapers, radio stations and government ministries—often where British expatriates were leaving. The exposure to Western professional practices boosted many of their careers. The IPI’s Nairobi school operated from 1963 to 1968 and was ‘probably the most effective’ of the more than a half dozen crash courses that sought, largely successfully, to put a Western stamp on African journalism education. Finally, both Ford and the IPI prized the network of journalists and officials they had forged almost as much as the education they had provided. },

  abstract = {This essay presents a detailed analysis of Georg Simon Ohm’s acoustical research between 1839 and 1844. Because of its importance in Hermann von Helmholtz’s subsequent study of sound and hearing, this work is rarely considered on its own terms. A thorough assessment of Ohm’s articles, however, can greatly enrich our understanding of later developments. Based on study of Ohm’s published writings, as well as a lengthy unpublished manuscript, the essay argues that his acoustical research foreshadows an important paradigmatic shift at a time of discursive instability prior to Helmholtz’s influential contributions. Using Ohm’s own dismissal of his supposedly “unmusical ears” as a conceptual frame, the essay describes this shift as a move away from understanding sound primarily in a musical context and toward an increasingly mathematical approach to sound and hearing. As such, Ohm’s work also anticipates a more general change in the role of the senses in nineteenth-century scientific research. },

  abstract = {This article proposes to view Freire’s thinking beyond a pedagogical method and rather as a model or even paradigm of development and social change. To build this as an original argument we firstly outline Freire’s ontological call, presenting and discussing his underlying five principles, of which one in particular, dialogue, situates Freirean thinking within communication theory. Secondly, we trace Freire’s legacy by presenting and discussing how Freire inspired three significant Ibero-American thinkers and practitioners within performing arts (Augusto Boal), communication (Juan Diaz Bordenave) and epistemology of change (Boaventura de Sousa Santos). This analysis underscores Freire’s significant legacy along global intellectual pathways both within humanities and social sciences. Finally, we deepen our analysis of Freire’s vision of development and social change, unpacking how he navigates between a normative vision grounded in a utopian aspiration for change, and a very systematic and rigorous methodology, his liberating pedagogy. },

  abstract = {Journalism scholars have acknowledged the importance of innovation in journalism. A common finding is that journalism has difficulty adapting to change and uses multiple coping mechanisms, including making excuses for not innovating by relying on their professional norms and practices. However, such research does not more broadly show how journalism studies research has shaped what scholars have learned about innovation practices. The goal of this study is to provide a systematic literature review of news innovation research since the 1990s. This article deploys a qualitative content analysis of peer-reviewed journal articles about news innovation in media and journalism studies. It shows that journalism and media scholars discuss news innovation as normative, participative, and experimentative. Journalism studies scholarship has also focused on innovation as a process, integrating elements of audience engagement, structure, system, and network. The goal of this study is twofold. First, it discusses the methodological and conceptual/theoretical approaches taken in scholarly journal articles about news innovation. Second, it outlines limitations of such approaches and draws conclusions to conceptualize knowledge in this subfield of research. It argues that it is important to take into account those limitations, as they pose problems for the cumulative nature of news innovation research knowledge. },

  abstract = {This article examines the collaborations between Marshall McLuhan, the architectural historian Sigfried Giedion, and the modernist town planner Jaqueline Tyrwhitt in the 1950s. Giedion’s studies of everyday material culture and his concern with the human scale of cities became central to McLuhan’s proposal for studying media. Through a historical analysis of Tyrwhitt’s papers and correspondence, the paper documents her role in mediating a dialogue between McLuhan and Giedion and in co-founding, with McLuhan and others, the Explorations Group at the University of Toronto. Drawing upon Giedion’s concern with the humanization of urban life, Tyrwhitt helped formulate a methodology that used the urban environment and architecture as the framework to analyze the effects of media. The paper argues that Tyrwhitt’s own contributions to the Explorations journal took up both Giedion and McLuhan’s focus on media and material culture and their commitment to interdisciplinarity in examining the mediated experience of urban life.Résumé : Cet article examine les collaborations pendant les années 50 entre Marshall McLuhan, l’historien de l’architecture Sigfried Giedion et l’urbaniste moderniste Jaqueline Tyrwhitt. Les études de la culture matérielle de tous les jours effectuées par Giedion et son souci d’assurer une dimension humaine aux villes sont devenus des éléments centraux dans l’approche aux médias proposée par McLuhan. Cet article, au moyen d’une analyse historique des archives et de la correspondance de Tyrwhitt, recense le rôle que celle-ci a joué pour encourager un dialogue entre McLuhan et Giedion et pour établir, avec McLuhan et d’autres, le groupe Explorations à l’Université de Toronto. Tyrwhitt, s’inspirant de la volonté de Giedion d’humaniser la vie urbaine, a contribué à l’élaboration d’une méthodologie qui se rapporte à l’environnement urbain et à l’architecture pour analyser les effets des médias. Cet article soutient que les contributions de Tyrwhitt à la revue Explorations ont tenu compte à la fois de l’accent mis par engagement interdisciplinaire afin d’étudier les expériences médiatisées de la vie urbaine.},

After pointing out some of the real political-economic forces at work in setting the contours of this intellectual turn, I discuss how spaces between mutually constructed but overlapping paradigmatic understandings of media behavior lead to theories that serve as boundary objects, linking (and misunderstanding) older fields in order to advance new agendas. I then turn to the consequences of particular methodological choices, drawing on key works in Science and Technology Studies (STS) to make the point that these methodological choices not only establish scientific fields, they construct certain types of human subjects as well. The article concludes with a call for a more humanistic and interpretive approach to the understanding of political behavior and communication.},

A case study of journalism studies results in the postulation of six conceptual commitments that define its core ontological and epistemological premises: contextual sensitivity, holistic relationality, comparative inclination, normative awareness, embedded communicative power, and methodological pluralism. These interrelated features articulate the central dimensions of journalism studies, establishing the boundaries of the field and its relational, cultural, holistic, ecological, and contextual acts of scholarship. This article provides a blueprint for other communication scholars to address assumptions and commitments that situate and define their subdisciplines as distinct fields.},

Therefore, it examines both the habitus and the capital of the 26 communication researchers from outside the United States who have been distinguished as ICA presidents and fellows. The study contributes to the discipline’s reflexivity and shows that despite the expansion of ICA’s leadership, the field’s power pole is still a U.S.-centered enterprise. Today, ICA’s international leadership is located in world regions closely linked to the United States and educated at U.S. universities or heavily influenced by North American research traditions, even if it includes a numerous contributions from other associations and alternative approaches. Consequently, this internationalization hardly changed ICA but instead changed the world’s communication field. At least up to a certain extent, new perspectives are perceived at the discipline’s power pole. However, in return, national academic environments in U.S.-affiliated countries became Americanized, especially via ICA fellows serving as role models to get scientific capital. Thus, ICA’s efforts to expand its leadership are assumed to have an unintended effect of conserving the power structures in the field.},

  abstract = {This article develops the concept of «operational media» to think through the deployment of utility/useful cinema in the context of cybernetically informed educational policy. The paper argues that cybernetic concepts of communication, feedback loops and homeostasis were central to the pragmatic installation of media at the center of postwar mass education. Links are made to the dominance of cybernetic ideas in postwar social science, including social psychology, sociobiology and behaviourism. A consideration of the UN’s operational media allows for a reconsideration of the agency’s communicative mandate as biopolitical and governmental. Educational policies influenced by the UN were doubly concerned with technologized classrooms: cybernetic ideas presented themselves as politically neutral, while offering efficiencies in the delivery of content. Cold war citizenship was thus conceived as a form of training that would pragmatically lead to the rebalancing of a volatile international situation. Carrefour de la vie (1949), made by Belgian filmmaker Henri Storck for the United Nations, is presented as an example of the centrality of mental health for citizenship training in postwar biopolitical regimes. In particular, the tension between the film’s humanist and cybernetic strands are considered. Au Carrefour de la vie is considered as a transitional text, presenting a humanist story of childhood in postwar life that simultaneously prefigures the operation of a controlled society.},

  abstract = {In April 1951 president Harry S. Truman established the Psychological Strategy Board to enhance and streamline America's sprawling psychological warfare campaign against the USSR. As soon as the Board's staff began work on improving US psychological operations, they wondered how social science might help them achieve their task. Board Director, Gordon Gray, asked physicist turned research administrator Henry Loomis to do a full review of America's social science research program in support of psychological operations. Loomis willingly accepted the task. This paper documents Loomis's investigation into America's social science research program. It uncovers the critical role that government departments had in the creation of research in the early 1950s and thus highlights that the government official is an important actor in the history of social science and the application of social science to psychological operations at the beginning of the Cold War.},

Canadian Communication Studies, despite its history of attending to the power dynamics of the center and the margins, is no exception to this rule. Studies of racism and colonialism are confined to the corners of the discipline, reflecting the lack of representation in communication departments, the canon, and in the field’s flagship journal. This sharply contrasts the prevalence of contemporary issues concerning race, religion, nationalism, nationwide Indigenous movements and anti-racist campaigns, as well as mobilizations against police violence, Islamophobia, and pipelines. Colonialism, race and racialization are central to the framing of these issues and demand urgent attention.}},

  abstract = {The rise of social media has recently inspired a renewed debate about the decentering of the subject. Some scholars have responded to Facebook’s seemingly intrusive influence over people’s emotions by reviving humanistic notions of the autonomous subject, while others have continued to insist on the subject’s constructedness. This article provides a historical perspective on this issue by revisiting another moment that, in some ways, parallels contemporary anxieties about social media. In the mid-18th century, critics worried that the increasing popularity of reading was producing unruly emotions and extreme opinions. These concerns inspired a number of attempts to reassert the primacy of spoken language, including programs of elocution instruction that trained people in reading out loud. Focusing on James Burgh’s 1761 book The Art of Speaking, this article argues that the elocution movement employed a different conception of selfhood from the modern notion of subjectivity: rather than treating the subject as the ultimate source of emotion, the elocutionists judged emotional reactions to texts based on a normative notion of the general good. I argue that this ethically grounded view of the self could provide a useful framework for understanding the stakes of the present anxiety about the emotional effects of media. },

  abstract = { AbstractScholars in both digital humanities and media studies have noted an apparent disconnect between computation and the interpretive methods of the humanities. Alan Liu has argued that literary scholars employing digital methods encounter a “meaning problem” due to the difficulty of reconciling algorithmic methods with interpretive ones. Conversely, the media scholar Friedrich Kittler has questioned the adequacy of hermeneutics as a means of studying computers. This paper argues that that this disconnect results from a set of contingent decisions made in both humanistic and mathematical disciplines in the first half of the nineteenth century that delineated, with implications that continue to resonate in the present day, which aspects of human activity would come to be formalized in algorithms and which would not. I begin with a discussion of Nicolas de Condorcet, who attempted, at the height of the 1789 revolution, to turn algebra into a universal language; his work, I argue, exemplifies the form of algorithmic thinking that existed before the Romantic turn. Next, I discuss William Wordsworth’s arguments about the relationship of poetry and science. While Wordsworth is sometimes viewed as a critic of science, I argue that his polemic is specifically targeted at highly politicized projects like Condorcet’s that sought to supplant existing modes of thought with scientific rationality. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of Romantic thought for George Boole, creator of the logic system that would eventually form the basis of digital electronics. The reason Boole was able to succeed where Condorcet had failed, I argue, was that Romantic notions of culture enabled him to reconcile a mechanical view of mathematical reasoning with an organic view of the development of meaning—a dichotomy that remains a key assumption of computer interfaces in the twenty-first century. },

  abstract = {{The study of media audiences has long been hotly contested regarding their supposed power to construct shared meanings, to mitigate or moderate media influences, or to complete or resist the circuit of culture. Transformations in the media environment add further grounds for contestation over audience activity or passivity, soâ€“called, given the increasing mediation and digitalization of all dimensions of modern societies. Yet despite such persistent contestation, audiences are often taken for granted within communication theory as, implicitly, an invisible and indivisible mass. The article notes that the audience projectâ€”and thus a grounded recognition of significance of ordinary people's collective and individual experiences of living in a digital ageâ€”seemingly must be reasserted for each generation of scholarship, rearticulating their role in relation to each new phase of sociotechnological change and, perhaps most interesting, reflexively rethinking â€œaudiencingâ€ as the very conditions of modernity are globally reconfigured. After reflecting on the possibility that Western audience researchers have come to take for granted the wider context of audiences' lives, the article observes that one benefit of globalization is a renewed necessity for researchers to articulate that which is taken for granted and thus seek ways to reinsert audiences into the wider analysis of the circuit of culture.}},

This article argues that further development of this research agenda requires ethnographies that attend to processes of encoding, including their precoded phases, and pay greater attention to the temporality, performativity, and materiality of communication. This is illustrated with reference to the rapidly shifting contemporary techno-social environments communicators face today.}},

Aiming to contribute to a more robust transnational history of communication research in the American continent we examine the works of Nelson Rockefeller's OIAA (Office of Inter-American Affairs) and Hadley Cantril in several Latin American countries. We argue that, despite the importance of these early studies, they are not considered in the official history of communication because they failed to leave institutional traces in Latin America and also due to the fact that transnational archival work has only seldom been considered an important source in Latin American history of communication. },

When the Commission began its work in 1943, though, it focused on an additional culprit. Pressure groups, according to the Commission, were propagandizing, issuing threats, and distorting media coverage. Pressure groups fell off the Commission’s agenda, in part because members and staff were unable to agree on whether the groups were democratic or antidemocratic forces. The Commission missed an opportunity to help shape subsequent debates over the anticommunist blacklists and other forms of nongovernmental media censorship. },

  abstract = {This study aims to examine the trends of internal communication research through a quantitative content analysis of published articles in public relations and other communication journals. Research topics, theoretical frameworks, methodology, and authorship information were analyzed using 223 articles. Results indicate that internal communication research in public relations scholarships has exponentially increased since 2011. Research topics on internal communication have diversified since 2000, from descriptive studies illustrating internal communication practices to a variety of relevant phenomena on employee and organizational outcomes. Public relations theories, such as organization–public relationship and symmetrical communication, have been frequently applied in internal communication research. In terms of methodology and sample, quantitative and qualitative methods have been equally utilized, and employees from multiple organizations were frequently used as a type of sample in a large portion of research works. The most productive researchers and institutions of internal communication research in public relations were also identified. Implications for ongoing internal communication research in public relations disciplines are discussed. To address the limitations of the current study, future studies should incorporate an interdisciplinary and a global perspective.},

Yet, there has been relatively little systematic examination of the growth of comparative journalism studies or in-depth analysis of the power relations within the field in relation to, for example, trends in authorship or dominant methodologies and paradigms. This article reports the results of a systematic review of comparative studies of journalism published between 2000 and 2015, a key growth period for the field. By examining in detail a population of 441 articles published in 22 key journals, we demonstrate that comparative journalism studies is a dynamic field that has developed considerable structure over time, and outline some key patterns, such as a continuing focus on Western authorship, the study of Western countries and elite media, quantitative methods of analysis and political aspects of journalism. },

It advances a historical sociology of knowledge inflected by feminist and postcolonial studies to trace the invention, institutionalization, and changing meanings of rhetorical theory from the late nineteenth century to the present. In the process, it illuminates three structuring patterns: (1) the valorization of European civilization that accompanied U.S. settler colonialism and its manifestation in universities where rhetorical theory materially grounded itself; (2) the gendered production of knowledge within academic institutions, particularly through the masculinization of the postwar university and its shaping of communities of inquiry invested in rhetorical theory; and (3) the power of relevance as a metonym for intellectual, political, and educational initiatives that, beginning in the late 1960s, enlarged rhetorical theory's community of inquiry and range of meanings.},

The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user’s mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user’s relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making. },

What are the differences between them? Are they three different research fields, or three national declinations of the same research program, or what else? Common to all of them nowadays is a more or less immediate reference to the British Cultural Studies, whose circulation however has been different across the three national cases, Italy, France, and Germany (together with Austria). Making use of an array of different sources and methods, this chapter tries to identify the commonalities among these reception histories (also in terms of epistemological foundations) without forgetting their peculiarities with respect to their social and political traditions. In all the three national/regional cases we will examine how the disciplinary and epistemological boundaries have been negotiated among different disciplines and (scholarly, political, and ideological) commitments in order to build new objects of research and a different sensitivity to matters of culture.},

  abstract = {Research activities related to social informatics (SI) are expanding, even as community fragmentation, topical dispersion, and methodological diversity continue to increase. Specifically, the different understandings of SI in regional communities have strong impacts, and each has a different history, methodological grounding, and often a different thematic focus. The aim of this article is to connect three selected perspectives on SI—intellectual (regional schools of thought), methodological, and thematic—and introduce a comparative framework for understanding SI that includes all known approaches. Thus, the article draws from a thematic and methodological grounding of research across schools of thought, along with definitions that rely on the extension and intension of the notion of SI. The article is built on a paralogy of views and pluralism typical of postmodern science. Because SI is forced to continually reform its research focus, due to the rapid development of information and communication technology, social changes and ideologies that surround computerization and informatization, the presented perspective maintains a high degree of flexibility, without the need to constantly redefine the boundaries, as is typical in modern science. This approach may support further developments in promoting and understanding SI worldwide.},

  abstract = {Academic interest in what has been termed “infotainment” has grown considerably since the term was coined in the 1980s. Today, the burgeoning field of infotainment research has become an important interdisciplinary field of study producing numerous political, cultural, and social insights. Nevertheless, infotainment remains highly contested, multifaceted, and incoherent, both as a term and a field of study. Preliminary attempts have been made to give greater conceptual clarity and standardization to the term, although their success has been limited, leaving difficulties in analyzing and comparing findings in a unified manner. In this review essay I outline the findings from a comprehensive literature review by delineating three mains trajectories of infotainment research: (1) research on soft news programming; (2) research on traditional news media; and (3) research on media systems and global infotainment. To conclude, I offer three suggestions for future infotainment research, arguing that scholars should attempt to achieve standardization and conceptual clarity within, rather than across research trajectories, that political theory should be more explicitly incorporated into the literature for the purposes of standardizing methods and clarifying normative debates, and that research should also focus on the synergies between contemporary trends in political campaign/communications strategies and trends in infotainment. },

The article presents the Frankfurt School as part of the 1940s’ memorandum culture and thereby attempts to situate the historiography of critical theory during this formative period within a broader intellectual landscape, that is, in dialogue and competition with several other projects, to analyze the Nazi German enemy, in this case, the Culture and Personality School. The article takes Kracauer’s and Bateson’s analyses of the Nazi movie Hitlerjunge Quex as a case in point and, with the help of institutional and biographical contextualization, develops some of their most important methodical innovations and insights into Nazi German propaganda. In particular, the article points to Kracauer’s concept of hypnosis and relates it to Bateson’s media theory.}},

  abstract = {The introduction of critical rhetoric into the discourse of rhetorical studies constituted an important rupture with previous traditions within the field. Emerging out of a complex mix of political, philosophical, and academic trends, critical rhetoric produced significant shifts in the ways in which criticism was understood and practiced. The shifting and transformations did not, however, stop with the term’s introduction in 1989. In this essay, we trace the development of critical rhetoric through three additional phases: the Marxist challenge presented by Dana Cloud; the shift to vernacular discourse in the works of Kent Ono and John Sloop; and the recent development of participatory critical rhetoric in the works of Michael Middleton et al. We pursue this historical tracing to demonstrate the points of rupture and discontinuity by which critical rhetoric has been transformed.},

  abstract = {Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to revisit Russell Belk’s (1988) landmark paper “Possessions and the extended self”. The authors provide a prehistory of related ideas and then examine the controversy it triggered regarding the different paradigms of research in marketing (Cohen, 1989) some 26 years ago. Design/methodology/approach– This paper takes Belk seriously when he argues that his work is a synthesis and extension of prior studies leading to the novel production of the “extended self” concept. Via a close reading of the history of self-constitution, the authors highlight a number of thinkers who were grappling with similar issues now associated in our disciplinary consciousness to the idea of the “extended self”. To assess the contribution of Belk’s work, the authors engage in citation and interpretive analyses. The first analysis compared scholarly citations of Belk (1988) with the top ten most-cited Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) papers published in the same year. The second citation analysis compared Belk (1988) to the top ten most-cited JCR papers in the history of the journal. The authors follow this with an interpretive analysis of Belk’s contribution to consumer research via his 1988 paper. Findings– Belk (1988) had the most citations (N = 934) of any paper published in JCR in 1988. When compared to all papers published in the history of JCR, Belk (1988) leads with the most overall citations. Moreover, Belk (1988) is the most prominent interpretive paper that appeared in JCR and one of the top three, regardless of paradigm. The analysis illustrates diversity in topic and methodology, thus indicating that Belk’s contribution impacted a wide variety of scholars. Interpretive analysis indicates the importance of Belk’s work for subsequently impactful consumer researchers. Originality/value– The authors offer a prehistory of the “extended self” concept by highlighting literature that many consumer researchers will not have explored previously. With citations spanning over three decades, consumer behavior scholars recognize Belk (1988) as an important paper. Our analysis reveals that contrary to received wisdom, it is not only important for interpretive researchers or scholars within the consumer culture theory, but it is significant for the entire discipline, irrespective of paradigmatic orientation. The research presented here demonstrates that Belk’s (1988) paper is arguably one of the most influential papers ever published in JCR.},

Rather, his writings and personal letters show how Adorno saw his time in California, the hothouse of the West’s most advanced culture industry, as an opportunity to scrutinize the modern condition. For Adorno, however, this did not have to be a bleak business. Instead, rigorous critique the way Adorno understood it did not mean to put the joys of life on hold and sideline the project of liberation but, on the contrary, to advance it by asserting its emancipatory promise that only pleasure can sustain. },

For someone who considered himself a dialectical thinker, Brecht showed surprisingly little interest in the specific historical dialectic that had shaped Los Angeles. Shortly after moving there, he had already accepted the myth of the “City of Angels” as a hellish materialization of advanced capitalism. The purpose of this essay, which mostly draws upon Brecht’s journal entries, is not to refute Davis’s assessment but to take a closer look at Brecht’s preconceptions and perceptions of American culture and politics to better grasp why he largely ignored, or refused to engage with, the politically progressive developments and working-class movement in a place where he spent six years of his life. },

This essay brings into focus the philosophical distinctions between the human science of communication and the social science of communication. Social science is argued to be the dominant paradigm in mainstream communication inquiry in the United States. Its underlying basis is information theory. Communicology is a human science that differs from social science in that it focuses not on the message but rather the cultural-semiotic constraints on embodied phenomenological experience. This is a unique human science approach. The grounds for comparison are located in the history of these contrasting views and in their problematic concerns. American pragmatism and social psychology are depicted as analogous to European philosophy and the Geisteswissenschaften. As this essay argues, the human science of embodied discourse is historically rooted in semiotics and phenomenology and lead to a synthesis in contemporary communicology. Communicology is distinguished from cultural studies, and a vision for the future discipline is advanced. },

These domains include: the history of marketing management, history of market research, history of market segmentation, product management history, retailing and channels history, promotion history, advertising history, the history of marketing thought, and marketing and the management of subjectivity, among others. Given obvious page limitations we have nevertheless tried to appeal to the paradigmatic span of the readers of the JMM.

@article{plotkindf,
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this essay is to argue that, for Veblen, the contribution of advertising to mature business enterprise was crucial. Although Thorstein Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class is widely credited with introducing the concept of “conspicuous consumption”, that book is silent on the contribution of the sales effort – or advertising – to such consumption. One must turn to Veblen’s later writings on the business system to find an analysis of advertising within oligopoly capitalism, what Veblen called the system of “absentee ownership”. At the beginning of the twentieth century business faced looming threats of technological progress and democratic discontent. The material prospect of accelerating productivity might soon “end the struggle or lessen the strain” of economic life; democracy might insist that the industrial system serve social needs in efficient ways. To ward off such challenges, business developed a two-prong approach to perpetuate scarcity: carefully managed control of output and an increasingly insistent, rationalized and expensive sales effort. The growth of advertising reflected a systematic expenditure of energy, talent and resources on a misdirection of human effort, one whose chief effect was to prolong “the strain” of everyday life in futile pursuit of waste. Whether such irrationality could be sustained indefinitely, or whether it might finally undermine the society that propels its pursuit, is an issue that Veblen raises, but to which he refuses to give any final answer. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyzes the full range of Veblen’s theoretical writings on consumption, technology and the sales effort. Findings – The paper insists that Veblen is the first radical political economist to provide a systematic critical analysis of advertising as an essential element of mature capitalism. Originality/value – The paper connects Veblen’s earliest thinking on “conspicuous consumption” to his mature analysis of advertising in the functioning of business enterprise. It will enrich understanding among academics and students, scholars of marketing and economic and social theorists, of Veblen’s critical analysis of the evolution of consumption, production and business enterprise.},

  abstract = {This article compares the sociological writings of Schutz and Becker on making music together. Schutz laid stress on the We-relationship resulting from face-to-face performance of music, in which every listener participates with the other listeners, the performers, and the composers. Becker emphasized the existence of taken-for-granted conventions on which cooperative relations between performers are based, in conjunction with other members of the music subcommunity with whom they are engaged in a communication flow. The involved actors may participate in several reciprocally connected worlds of shared experiences, which if jointly considered constitute the art world. The theoretical and conceptual differences between Schutz and Becker, which concern their sociological writings on music, are related to analogous diversities between Phenomenological Sociology and Symbolic Interactionism. Finally, Weber, Honigsheim, and Adorno’s contributions to the sociology of music have been here considered for comparative purposes. },

  abstract = {Background Marshall McLuhan was not only a prolifc reader but also an expert annotator of his own books. Taking as a case study McLuhan's copies of James Joyce's Ulysses in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto, this article asks what we can learn about McLuhan's reading from close analysis of his own books. Analysis The article begins with a discussion of McLuhan's media theory as "applied Joyce, " with particular reference to Ulysses, and then turns to an overview of the annotation techniques and strategies visible in McLuhan's copies of the novel. Conclusion and implications The conclusion considers McLuhan's own books as hybrid artifacts that challenge us to rethink rigid distinctions between print and manuscript cultures. },

  abstract = {This study systematically analyzes Engineering of Consent (EOC)-focused scholarly papers published between 1947 and 2018 using content analysis and text mining. It aims to shed light on the progress of EOC research and related disciplines as well as the methodologies, data collection methods, major perspectives, and most frequent words used within these writings. Additionally, this study considers publications by region and the affiliations of first authors. The results show that only a small number of EOC-focused papers have been published since 1947; this area of public relations research has suffered from a lack of scholarly attention despite its relevance to various disciplines, and this is a situation that we hope improves. Recent trends have shown some reasons for optimism. We found that at least one EOC-focused paper has been published annually in most years since 2000 (the exceptions are 2001, 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2015). Our research shows that scholars in the fields of public relations, media studies, and political science published more papers on EOC than scholars in other fields. Research articles usually utilize qualitative research methodologies. Interviews stand out as the most widely used data collection method. Our analysis of publications by region and first-author affiliation shows that the majority of EOC papers were written by faculty and students working or studying in the United States. Seven perspectives frequently discussed by scholars and the most frequently used words within EOC papers are highlighted in a follow-up qualitative review.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on broadcast transcripts created by multilingual BBC monitors during the Second World War—which have received little scholarly attention—to consider how conflicting political discourses in wartime India were configured through the airwaves. As both Allied and Axis propaganda vied for the ‘hearts and minds’ of Indian audiences, how did the subcontinent become a geopolitical hotspot, particularly in 1942 with the threat of Japanese invasion, launch of the anticolonial Quit India movement and Subhas Chandra Bose’s nationalist broadcasts from pirate radio stations in Germany? This paper is interested in uncovering how the Indian listener would have ‘tuned in’, along with understanding monitors’ agency in selecting, editing, translating and transcribing these India-oriented transmissions. It seeks to broaden the frames of reference of broadcast history by focusing on non-European/non-US wartime listenership and surveillance, and argues for the value of BBC monitoring transcripts in interrogating the complex relationship between Indian decolonisation and war. },

  abstract = {Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, a Dutch government in exile was set up in London. One of the most important activities of these exiles was to make propaganda against the Nazi’s and throughout the war they operated Radio Oranje (Radio Orange), a wireless station that broadcasted to the Netherlands using BBC-transmitters. Another part of the Dutch broadcasting outfit in England was a ‘listening service’ that made daily reports about Dutch-language radio broadcasts from Hilversum by the Nazi regime. This article draws from a complete, and previously unused, set of these monitoring reports to analyse the Dutch propaganda war in the ether. The source material reveals that notions of Dutch neutrality were central to the radio broadcasts at both sides of the North Sea. In addition, the reports show how the London broadcasters singled out and targeted specific Nazi propagandists whom they thought to be the most dangerous. },

This special issue titled Ferments in the Field: The Past, Present and Future of Communication Studies presents 20 articles, plus this introduction, with the intention to assess the field and provoke discussions about the status of communication studies.

They include: (a) communication studies on a global scale, (b) researching communication in the fast-changing digital media environment, (c) the importance of critical communication studies, (d) the new critical and materialist turn, and (e) praxis communication and ways to address power imbalance in knowledge production.}},

As part of an ongoing movement to decenter White masculinity as the normative core of scholarly inquiry, this paper is meant as a preliminary intervention. By coding and analyzing the racial composition of primary authors of both articles and citations in journals between 1990–2016, we find that non-White scholars continue to be underrepresented in publication rates, citation rates, and editorial positions in communication studies. We offer some analysis as to why these findings matter in our current political moment, and propose steps the field might take towards further documenting and rectifying race and representation in the production of disciplinary knowledge.}},

Among the recorded gaps is the overwhelmingly small representation of voices outside the United States. The assumption of interdisciplinarity is also questioned, as primary journal contributors were limited to a small set of sub-disciplines. The results also reveal a dominance of the (post-)positivistic paradigm and quantitative methods. While the relative proportion of atheoretical research is decreasing, there is also a remarkable slowdown in new theory development. Finally, with a steep decline in federal funding, communication scholars are becoming more reliant on universities, public organizations, and private donors.}},

  abstract = {{Mass communication was one of the central signs through which communication research constituted itself in the post-World War II era. An American term, it indexed and communicatively advanced the problematization of media that took shape from the 1920s onward. Recently, scholars have debated the term’s continued relevance, typically without awareness of its history or international contexts of use. To provide needed background and enrich efforts to globalize the field, we offer a transnational history of mass communication, illuminating the sociological, cultural, and geopolitical dynamics of its emergence, dissemination, and reception. Mapping locations of its adoption, adaption, and rejection across world regions, we offer a methodology and a historical narrative to shed light on the early globalization of the field and lines of power and resistance that shaped it. We show how the term carries a residue of postwar American hegemony, and argue for greater reflexive awareness of our vocabularies of inquiry.}},

That issue probed the impact of this internationally acclaimed new wave at the zenith of its success. At a time of widespread enthusiasm for this countercinema, the editors expressed concerns about the ways in which many American critical treatments of recent West German cinema had “misread, ignored or distorted its place within the long range history and present context of the German Federal Republic.” By and large, these analyses, however well intentioned, focused on textual idiosyncrasies and gave short shrift to contextual determinants; for that reason they failed “to connect the aesthetics of contemporary filmmaking to the political and social traditions emerging from the Weimar and fascist periods” and to the production of culture within the West German public sphere.2}},

The present article provides an updated review of the academic literature devoted to the study of the Eurovision Song Contest which in the past two decades developed into a serious and rich academic field with four main areas: (1) studies of imagining a unified Europe – wherein I review research devoted to cosmopolitan European visions and nation branding; (2) studies focusing on gender and what is often referenced as gay or ‘camp’ features in the Eurovision Song Contest; (3) studies of Euro-Divisions which focus on political bloc voting and cultural alliances – exposing consistent and persistent rifts and coalitions in the celebration of European unity; and (4) studies making use of Eurovision data as a cultural seismograph for explaining external phenomenon like economic trade and political conflicts. Two decades of study of the Eurovision reveal that the ideal of unity is persistently challenged by national and cultural commitments. While commentators often deem the Eurovision Song Contest to be a silly kitsch show of musical mediocrity, this review proves it to be an appealing and productive area for the serious study of European civilization and its discontents. },

A decade later, what hath such research wrought? In the broad study of news and its digital transformation, few topics have captivated researchers quite like social media, with hundreds of studies on everything from how journalists use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat to how such platforms facilitate various forms of engagement between journalists and audiences. Now, some 10 years into journalism studies on social media, we need a more particular accounting of the assumptions, biases, and blind spots that have crept into this line of research. Our purpose is to provoke reflection and chart a path for future research by critiquing themes of what has come before. In particular, our goal is to untangle three faulty assumptions—often implicit but no less influential—that have been overlooked in the rapid take-up of social media as a key phenomenon for journalism studies: (1) that social media would be a net positive; (2) that social media reflects reality; and (3) that social media matters over and above other factors.},

It argues, after an analytical crisscrossing of individuals, research traditions, ideas, institutions, and their relationships that lie behind Four Theories, that the book was a compromise between the diverse interests of its authors, their backgrounds, ideas, and national and international politics, and thus an intersection of contradictory but also overlapping elements that also gave rise to new concepts of a press system and of a press theory in a transnational context.},

  abstract = {Ten years ago Davison formulated the third-person effect hypothesis, a novel approach to the study of public opinion. Davison proposed that individuals typically assume that mass communications exert a stronger impact on others than the self, and he derived some interesting ideas from this notion. Over the past decade, a number of studies have tested predictions derived from Davison's formulation. This paper reviews and synthesizes research on the third-person effect. A systematic review of third-person effect studies indicates that there is abundant support for the notion that individuals assume that communications exert a stronger influence on others than on the self. However, the third-person effect does not emerge in all circumstances and for all people. The effect appears to be particularly likely to emerge when the message contains recommendations that are not perceived to be personally beneficial, when individuals perceive that the issue is personally important, and when they perceive that the source harbors a negative bias. Considerably less is known about the processes that underlie the third-person effect. This paper proposes several explanations for the effect, and it suggests some directions for future research in this area.},

To address this, we first develop a typology that distinguishes between approaches that foreground the role of media and communication as an agent of change, and approaches that treat media and communication as an environment for change. We then use this typology to identify key trends in the field since 1951, including the sharp downturn in work focusing on economic aspects of change after 1985, the decline of grand narratives of social change since 2000 and the parallel return to media effects. We conclude by outlining the key traits of a processual approach to social change, which has the capacity to offer the basis for shared language in the field. This language can enable us to think of media, communication and social change across its varied temporal and social planes, and link together the processes involved in the reproduction of status quo with fundamental changes to social order.},

This is heavily indebted to his theory of symbolic exchange, drawn from the Durkheimian tradition running through Durkheim, Mauss, Caillois and Bataille. Common to all these authors is s specific view of human relations, derived from their anthropology, as involving both a communication and a confrontation. Baudrillard, therefore, sees the modern semiotic order as based on the destruction of these symbolic relations, and its media accordingly as founded on a `non-communication'. In symbolic exchange, however, Baudrillard presents a complete and coherent theory of power, and his theory of communication illustrates the possibilities of transformation and reversal of established power and the system of non-communication which the reinstitution of symbolic relations can bring about.},

  abstract = {With studies like Discourse Networks 1800/1900 and Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Friedrich A. Kittler contributed significantly to transforming the history of media into a vital field of inquiry. This essay undertakes to more precisely characterize Kittler's historiographical approach. When we look back on his early contributions to studies of the relationship between literature, madness and truth \textendash{} among others, his doctoral dissertation on the Swiss poet and writer Conrad Ferdinand Meyer \textendash{} what strikes us is the significance that Jacques Lacan's structuralist psychoanalysis had in shaping the orientation of Kittler's later studies. His intensive engagement with Lacan galvanized Kittler's concern with the question of sex and/or gender in the evolution of the humanities as well as his concern with the media history of the university. At the same time, Kittler's reliance on Lacan led him to a kind of history that is interested above all in the internal logic of discourse. As we see, for instance, in Kittler's anecdotic treatment of 19th-century physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz, this historiography does not involve any original research in archives and/or museums. Rather, it builds upon existing historical accounts and focuses its analyses on the issue of symbolic structures. Instead of investigating the history of the material culture of science and technology, what is thereby ultimately reinforced is a philosophical idealism in which knowledge and paranoia become superimposed in and by means of an `original syntax' (Lacan).},

It then looks forward to recent work in the sociology of expectations, to consider the role of future predictions. The article concludes that audience research is perhaps not a field or a discipline, although the aspiration to be so is not altogether a bad thing. The article suggests that the best destiny for the field is to be a rogue element within the broader media, communication, and cultural studies domain, demanding\textemdash{}and providing\textemdash{}empirical evidence in the face of normatively charged claims.},

@book{killen_homo_2017,
  abstract = {In the early decades of the twentieth century, two intertwined changes began to shape the direction of German society. The baptism of the German film industry took place amid post-World War I conditions of political and social breakdown, and the cultural vacuum left by collapsing institutions was partially filled by moving images. At the same time, the emerging human sciences\textemdash{}psychiatry, neurology, sexology, eugenics, industrial psychology, and psychoanalysis\textemdash{}began to play an increasingly significant role in setting the terms for the way Germany analyzed itself and the problems it had inherited from its authoritarian past, the modernizing process, and war. Moreover, in advancing their professional and social goals, these sciences became heavily reliant on motion pictures.Situated at the intersection of film studies, the history of science and medicine, and the history of modern Germany, Homo Cinematicus connects the rise of cinema as a social institution to an inquiry into the history of knowledge production in the human sciences. Taking its title from a term coined in 1919 by commentator Wilhelm Stapel to identify a new social type that had been created by the emergence of cinema, Killen's book explores how a new class of experts in these new disciplines converged on the figure of the "homo cinematicus" and made him central to many of that era's major narratives and social policy initiatives.Killen traces film's use by the human sciences as a tool for producing, communicating, and popularizing new kinds of knowledge, as well as the ways that this alliance was challenged by popular films that interrogated the truth claims of both modern science and scientific cinema. In doing so, Homo Cinematicus endeavors to move beyond the divide between scientific and popular film, examining their historical coexistence and coevolution.},

  abstract = {This article is an examination of Edgar Dale's Film Appreciation programme, from its beginnings in 1933 with the release of How to Appreciation Motion Pictures to its eventual demise in the 1940s. Its central focus is an evaluation of literary adaptations in this pedagogical history; investigating how adaptations of canonical literature were instrumental in the development of film education, and examining how such films were used in the development of teaching materials. Using reports and papers written during the 1930s as its primary evidence, and a comparative analysis of two original study guides on David Copperfield (1935) and A Tale of Two Cities (1935), this article gives a detailed account of how film appreciation was taught in American high schools and exposes the programme's ideological underpinnings. Through an evaluation of such sources the article proposes that whilst using literary adaptations provided a culturally valorized rationale for film education, its reliance on the prestige of literature was ultimately responsible for its failure, since it maintained and promoted the hierarchies between cultural forms.},

I revisit the history of audience research to show how empirical findings contested the pejorative conception of the audience problematically yet persistently imagined by theorists of media power during the twentieth century. As media studies joins other disciplines in responding to the growing datafication of society, I propose that the circuit of culture model can help theorize media (including platform and algorithmic) power by opening up the hermeneutic and action space between production and consumption. In this way, critical scholarship might more effectively analyze such metaprocesses as mediatization and datafication precisely by recognizing rather than erasing audiences' relation to both the everyday lifeworld and the public world of citizen action, regulatory intervention, and the wider society.},

  abstract = {Audience reception research was a child of the broadcasting age, emerging strongly as a subdiscipline in media and communication research in the 1980s. Many saw reception research as a cross-fertilizing force theoretically and methodologically, bringing together research traditions from the humanities and the social sciences, and adding a qualitative orientation to the near-hegemonic rule of quantitative methods in audience research. This article discusses the ways in which reception research is reinventing itself in a post-broadcasting age. With sense-making processes as the continued key concern, three transformations are affecting the trajectory of reception research: An empirical shift has occurred from analyzing viewers' ``decoding'' encounters with media ``texts'' to mapping audience participation in the wider mediascapes of traditional, digital, and social media; a theoretical adoption of, and contributions to, theories of participation and mediatization; and a methodological shift from purely qualitative to a mixed-method research design.},

This special issue, quite fittingly for this journal, brings together a series of articles, which are written by a set of communication scholars who frequently delve into the messy world that is empirical audience research, but who reflect, here, on the very state and status of the field as it navigates a moment in communication studies scholarship where datafication challenges, perplexes, frustrates, enthuses, and, increasingly, engages in some way or another most communication scholars one meets. In this short editorial, I look at the ways in which these articles approach the field of audience research itself, at a point in time when datafication poses an array of new challenges to mediated societies.},

This article argues that communication-centric analyses fail to engage the politics of information itself, limiting information only to its consequences for communication, and neglecting information as it reaches into our selves, lives, and actions beyond the confines of communication. Furthering recent new media historiography on the ``information theory'' of Shannon and Wiener, the article reveals both the primacy of communication in midcentury information theory, and also a striking resonance between these postwar communication theories and Habermas's more recent communicative theory of democracy. To achieve a critical perspective beyond communication, the article proposes a media genealogy of the politics of subjects as a methodology for developing an analysis of how information formats us as subjects of data.},

  abstract = {The paper discusses how Nigerian journalism education has been heavily influenced by the American model. Nigeria, being a former British colony, at first followed British models of vocational training in journalism. This is evident in the fact that the country's universities did not initially embrace journalism and mass communication studies. Formal university-level training in journalism only started in Nigeria in 1962, with the establishment of Jackson College of Journalism at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The college later developed into the Department of Mass Communication. Other departments/schools of journalism or mass communication have sprung up at various Nigerian universities, notably that of the University of Lagos. In the past few years, there has been an upsurge in the number of mass communication programmes across the country. The programmes, apart from journalism, offer courses in broadcasting, public relations and advertising, among other areas. The paper also discusses how contemporary postcolonial Nigerian media education has achieved a large degree of uniformity in all the programmes as a result of initiatives taken by Nigeria's National Universities Commission.},

The authors discovered a disparity between the realization of the information society in everyday life and the state of the research in the area which is at a fairly early stage of evolving into a mature research discipline. Preliminary analysis of the data uncovers the three disciplinary foundations as Library and Information Science, Communication, and Information systems. The Bradford distribution reveals that the core of information society journals is not yet fully established. Journal citation and self-citation patterns lend further support for this and help identify which journals are firmly part of the core and which are less so. Finally, research collaboration patterns demonstrate that this area of research is moving towards disciplinary maturity. The paper concludes with some practical and academic recommendations.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the intellectual development of cultural studies in Latin America in order to assess current challenges and identify lines of research. It is argued that much of the literature has failed to seriously consider key points of cultural studies, namely, the need to be critical about its own epistemological premises and the need to study culture within broad social formations. Since the landmark studies by N{\'e}stor Garc{\'i}a Canclini and Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero laid the foundations in the 1980s, the field of cultural studies has generally aimed to illustrate original arguments instead of using them as a point of departure to analyze media and cultural phenomena. Consequently, many scholars have produced work that while it proves and illustrates original arguments about the hybrid nature of cultures and the complexity of cultural mediation, it does not push the field in new theoretical directions. An additional problem is that, often, the study of culture has been divorced from a close inspection of the linkages between cultural, political, and economic processes, and from the articulations between high and low culture. Consequently, the political underpinnings of the enterprise of cultural studies, as outlined by Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall, have been in the background. This choice has, arguably, restrained the intellectual development and undermined the potential to move theory-building and the debate forward. Additionally, the disinterest in critically exploring theoretical premises has diminished the potential to transcend the boundaries of '' area studies'' in order to engage with the study of media and culture as well as cultural studies globally. The paper concludes by suggesting research directions that might contribute to overcoming the current intellectual impasse.},

While the term media ecology was coined by Marshall McLuhan, it is Postman who defined and expanded its meaning over the course of a career that now spans twenty four books and innumerable articles, creating, in the process, a theory of media of great power and coherence, and which continues to generate new thinking and understanding. The essay outlines Postman's theory of media ecology as it is based in four themes that recur across his work: media education; media/cultural conservatism; technological criticism; and general semantics, or the study of language as medium/technology.},

  abstract = {This study examines the graduate training and research styles of some of Kurt Lewin's intellectual descendents. Specifically the question addressed was: What aspects of the social psychological environment at the Research Center for Group Dynamics while it was at MIT (1945-1948), enabled certain gifted students to develop the skills, enthusiasm and self-permission to be productive later in their careers and in turn, to foster younger scientists to do the same? Those aspect of Lewin's training which may have been responsible for the creative productivity of his intellectual descendents are the focus of this inquiry. These include the influence of Lewin's theory, the experimental method he brought to complex social phenomena as well as his personal style and approach to psychology. Twenty in-depth interviews were carried out and make up an oral history of the graduate training of some of Lewin's descendents. Those interviewed included three faculty members and six social psychologists who were graduate students at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. Also interviewed were eight social psychologists who were trained by members of the original MIT group, two social psychologists who were trained by one of the second generation Lewinians, and one social psychologist with close ties to the group. Some of the aspects of Lewin's training environment which were handed down by his students include: Immediate immersion in research with little emphasis on course work, an interdependent working style in which problem-solving research meetings known as the Quasselstrippe played a key part, task centeredness, intense scrutiny of data, self identification as scientists and use of an apprenticeship method of training. One model of graduate training is to purposefully train students in the art of scientific investigation in order to produce quality researchers. Another model, one followed by some members of the Lewin group, involves selecting the best students and carefully supervising them in order to produce quality research. Beginning with Lewin himself, training students has been a by-product of the pursuit of scientific understanding.},

  abstract = {Politicians, Government Officials, and Public Relations Officers Lean heavily on polling when fashioning public policy. Proponents say this is for the best, arguing that surveys bring the views of citizens closer to civic officials. Critics decry polling's promotion of sycophantic politicians who pander to the whims of public sentiment or conversely, the use of surveys by special interests to thwart the majority will. claims and criticisms were made during the early days of polling. When George Gallup began polling Americans in 1935, he heralded it as a bold step in popular democrat: The views of ordinary citizens could now be heard alongside those of organized interest groups. When brought to Canada in 1941, the Gallup Poll promised similar democratic rejuvenation. In actual practice, traditionally disadvantaged constituencies such as women, the poor, French Canadians in Canada, and African Americans in the United States were often heavily under-represented in Gallup surveys. Preoccupied with election forecasting, Gallup pollsters under-counted social groups thought less likely or unable to vote, leading to a considerable gap between the sampled polity and the general public. Examining the origins and early years of public opinion polling in Canada, Robinson situates polling within the larger context of its forerunners \textendash{} market research surveys and American opinion polling \textendash{} and charts its growth until its first uses by political parties.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1990s, media literacy has become an increasingly prominent paradigm within the fields of media and communication studies in the United States and elsewhere. This article investigates the convergence of forces in that propelled this approach to its currently ascendant position. With a nod to Harvey J. Graff's analysis of the mythic power associated with the concept of literacy, the article explores the techniques and rationales that have coalesced around media literacy, making it at once central to the operation of neoliberal capitalism and to its critique. Putting media literacy into a longer history of the instrumental and biopolitical use of media in education and considering the role of education in connecting children's interests to moral and economic regulation, media literacy is taken to be the most recent iteration of a long-standing set of ideas that have been taken up in different ways by early educational reformers, postwar development communications theorists, and countercultural media educators.},

A new revisionist movement has emerged that challenges the dominant radical paradigms of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This has taken the form of contesting the underlying models of society, the characterization of media organizations, the representations of media content, the conception of the audience and the aesthetic judgements that underpinned much `critical' research. The author argues that this revisionism is in part a reversion to certain discredited conventional wisdoms of the past, a revivalism masquerading as new and innovatory thought. However, part of the new critique can be seen as a reformulation that could potentially strengthen the radical tradition of communications research.},

From this perspective it becomes important that we explore how marketing theory comes to be ordered in the way it presently is, and the manner in which certain ideas develop or face extinction, in order to better understand what can or cannot be said in market- ing theory. In response, this article argues that a much needed turn in the paradigm debate should be toward the exploration of the institutionalization of marketing theory. It examines the social, economic and institutional logic underpinning theory production in marketing and demonstrates the influence of McCarthyism and the Cold War climate on marketing theory.},

The data come from four main sources: (1) a survey conducted among Latin American scholars (N = 50), to determine their opinions about the origins, growth, and present state of communication research in the region; (2) a survey conducted among U.S. scholars with experience in Latin America (N = 51), to determine the same information as above but from a point of view that we suspect is somewhat different from that within the region; (3) a citation analysis of the main communication journals to determine the different intellectual influences on Latin American communication scholars; and (4) a content analysis of research published in seven major English language communication journals, and ten major Latin American journals to determine the main topics studied by each group of scholars. Structurally, this dissertation has seven parts. Chapter I introduces the topic and discusses the purpose, central research questions, and research methods. Chapter II deals with the way in which the different research traditions have grown in the region, as well as with the characteristics of the various studies conducted so far on the growth of communication research in Latin America. Chapter III describes the various methods of data collection and data analysis used in the present study. Chapters IV through VI present the major research findings regarding the following issues: (1) stages of development of communication research in Latin America, internal and external factors that determined the emergence of the discipline in the region, its milestones, and major changes over time; (2) major Latin American communication journals and research topics, most influential authors, and countries where research has been conducted; (3) main obstacles to communication research in Latin America, present state of the discipline, and expected changes for the near future. Finally, Chapter VII discusses the results at length, summarizes the main findings, considers some practical and theoretical implications of the study, and suggests further research.},

It analyzes the relationships between major scholarship on alternative media and various historical contexts in order to discover various conceptions' limitations and possibilities. The value of such a study is not only how it recovers the variety of ways in which alternative media have been thought. By doing so, it also reminds readers of the necessary relation between theoretical conceptions and historical conditions remarked on by scholars. Such a study also reminds of the contingency of conceptions today, which typically emphasize separately or in combination (a) a kind of content, (b) a means of funding, or (c) the use of new technologies. The article begins by tracing the emergence and development of a dominant interpretive theory based in vanguardism, essentialism, and technological determinism, and concludes by discussing recent efforts that are grounded in materialist theories of culture and society. Such a change signals an ongoing project of generating understandings of alternative media that suggest the reciprocal relationships between modes of production, media forms, and oppositional, participatory practice.},

Over this time period, the desire for consumer products becomes figured by industry observers and researchers as a mode of children's "self expression." The analytic isolation of "the child" in the persona of a "consumer" authorizes a new morality for consumption by construing children's desire for goods as preexistent and thus natural.},

The latter half of the 19th century began with newspaper editor Horace Greeley sending the population West and closed with publisher William Randolph Heart promoting war with Spain. In the first half of the 20th century, reluctant Americans were rallied to fight in World War I, Orson Welles dramatized the H. G. Wells novel War of the Worlds, creating a nationwide panic, and the Nazi party gained control of the government in Germany, all with the help of new methods of mass communication. Do mass media still hold these powers, or is the public less naive? This chapter considers the debate over media effects in a broad historical perspective and rethinks some of the popular assumptions of the 20th century.},

It is also an allegory of Jewish-ethnic identity in mid-twentieth-century America and a side-ways commentary on modern Jewish involvement in communications. The book participates in a utopian imagination of society in which Jews and Gentiles alike would be centrally involved in the flow of communications. It turns from Gentile-style status toward Jewish-style connectivity as the basis of social power; defends socially grounded conceptions of mental life against Gentile individualism; insists in its notion of the two-step flow on the rabbinic principle that a text without a commentary is meaningless; and performs some amazing intellectual-moral-historical footwork with the most inconspicuous of all its central terms, '' people.'' In all these things, it can be read as a '' Jewish'' text in some sense.},

AJC scholarship has shown its Asian uniqueness by exploring social and cultural comparisons focusing on a few East Asian countries. It has also followed Western communication scholarship by investigating effects of political communication and news media, as well as advertising using television in the United States, similar to JMCQ.

  abstract = {The subject of this article is the emigration of German-speaking communication researchers after 1933 to the US and other countries. The article focuses on Zeitungswissenschaft (newspaper studies) in Weimar Germany and its lost works. Lost, because some of the most brilliant protagonists of this new academic field, which was first established in 1918 at the University of Leipzig, were refugees from Nazi Germany. Often, they were not able to enter an international setting of communication science due to the ruptures in their lives and careers. Their books have not been translated. These theoretical approaches were mainly of sociological impact and far from simple stimulus-response models. The Third Reich, with its aims of propaganda and lack of scientific relevance in the field, marked an end-point to a very innovative process-oriented way of thinking in early communication science in Germany. Most of the protagonists of this new thinking emigrated: for example, the sociologists Karl Mannheim and Ernest Manheim, the communication researchers Walter Auerbach and Gerhard M{\"u}nzner. This article outlines the theoretical background of early communication science in Germany and the context of racist and political persecution and emigration as a social and intellectual breakdown of this science. Actually, this breakdown gains new interest in the German academic community; the past of German communication science and its very dark sides have become topics of discussion and research.},

  abstract = {This article examines the intellectual history of the concept of 'publicity', originally defined by Immanuel Kant as the transcendental formula of public justice and the principle of the public use of reason, but later largely subsumed under the concept of 'freedom of the press'. The notion of the press as the Fourth Estate/Power was a valid concept and legitimate form of the institutionalization of the principle of publicity in the period when newspapers emanated from a new (bourgeois) estate or class: they had a different source of legitimacy than the three classic powers, and developed as a critical impulse against the old ruling estates. Yet the discrimination in favor of the power/control function of the press, which relates to the need of 'distrustful surveillance' defended by Bentham, clearly abstracted freedom of the press from the Kantian quest for the public use of reason. In democratic societies where the people rather than different estates legitimize all the powers, the control dimension of publicity embodied in the corporate freedom of the press should be effectively supplemented by actions toward equalizing private citizens in the public use of reason.},

Through comparative analyses of Bal{\'a}zs with the racial physiognomist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss as well as with Bal{\'a}zs's fellow Marxist Walter Benjamin, this article outlines key aspects of both right-wing and left-wing physiognomics. While Bal{\'a}zs did share with reactionary physiognomists the problematic idealist tendency to view the body as materialized soul, his views on physiognomy evaded racial essentialism, as he promoted cinematic physiognomics as a way to overcome boundaries of race and nation. Furthermore, Bal{\'a}zs and Benjamin used physiognomic perception to reconfigure social hierarchies and the relationship of spectators to technology and the material world, thus converting potentially reactionary concepts into ones that could be made serviceable for Marxism.},

  abstract = {The scientific pollsters (Archibald Crossley, George H. Gallup, and Elmo Roper) emerged onto the American news media scene in 1935. Much of what they did in the following years (1935\textendash{}1948) was to promote both the political and scientific legitimacy of their enterprise. They sought to be recognized as the sole legitimate producers of public opinion. In this essay I examine the, mostly overlooked, rhetorical work deployed by the pollsters to publicize the scientific credentials of their polling activities, and the central role the concept of sampling has had in that pursuit. First, they distanced themselves from the failed straw poll by claiming that their sampling methodology based on quotas was informed by science. Second, although in practice they did not use random sampling, they relied on it rhetorically to derive the symbolic benefits of being associated with the '' laws of probability.''},

  abstract = {The authors examine two classic research studies from the 1950s: David Manning White's analysis of the "gatekeeper" news editor and Warren Breed's explanation of social control in the newsroom. Although posing a potentially radical question- "What makes news?"-these efforts were largely absorbed into and reinforced the limited media effects paradigm of the time. Drawing from interviews with the authors, the authors of this article trace the origin, impact, and intellectual context of these forerunners of media sociology. The authors argue that although these two studies were exceptions to the field's preoccupation with audience and effects, they nevertheless accepted and implicitly reinforced the prevailing media framework built around the commercial publishing and broadcasting industries. As such, they resemble much of the field's research, grounded as it has been in the "limited effects" reinforcement perspective of Lazarsfeld and the broader functionalist tradition of Merton. By calling the news construction process into question, both studies presented potential challenges to the "taken for granted" nature of the media.},

A content analysis of 961 articles reveals that less than 4 percent focused on the Internet during the examined six-year timeframe. However, the total number of Internet-related articles published per year appeared to increase over time. Several challenges faced by communication researchers and journals in positioning the Internet within the discipline are discussed.},

Natural law honors universal law but allows situational responsiveness within this universal. A branch of the natural law tradition is casuistry, which applies practical reasoning to specific cases in order to discern the most moral course of action. Toulmin advocated a renewal of the use of casuistry because it is inherently more rhetorical and therefore more applicable than universal ethics, but his theories of argumentation and rhetoric reflect an understanding of the interplay between universal and particular.},

  abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to chart the influence of McCarthyism and of FBI surveillance practices on a number of prominent American social scientists, market researchers, opinion pollsters and survey research practitioners during the post-war years. Hitherto disparate sets of historical evidence on how Red Scare tactics influenced social researchers and marketing scientists are brought together and updated with evidence from original archival research. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on the existing secondary literature on how social research practitioners and social scientists reacted to the unusually high pressures on academic freedom during the McCarthy era. It supplements this review with evidence obtained from archival research, including declassified FBI files. The focus of this paper is set on prominent individuals, mainly Bernard Berelson, Samuel Stouffer, Hadley Cantril, Robert S. Lynd, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Herta Herzog, Ernest Dichter, but also the Frankfurt School in exile. Findings - Although some of the historiography presents American social scientists and practitioners in the marketing research sector as victims of McCarthyism and FBI surveillance, it can also be shown that virtually all individuals in focus here also developed strategies of accommodation, compromise and even opportunism to benefit from the climate of suspicion brought about by the prevailing anti-Communism. Social implications - Anyone interested in questions about the morality of marketing, market research and opinion polling as part of the social sciences practicedin vivo will need to pay attention to the way these social-scientific practices became tarnished by the way prominent researchers accommodated and at times even abetted McCarthyism. Originality/value - Against the view of social scientists as harassed academic minority, evidence is presented in this paper which shows American social scientists who researched market-related phenomena, like media, voters choices and consumer behaviour, in a different light. Most importantly, this paper for the first time presents archival evidence on the scale of Paul F. Lazarsfeld's surveillance by the FBI.},

Among other notes, this article contends that the origins of a leading theory of digital communication may best be understood not as a disembodied abstraction of information, but rather in the messy world of biographical influences that helped usher in a cold war era of calculating communication.},

  abstract = {Given the large amount of completed research and the existence of several undergraduate and graduate programs, we can say that cultural studies is currently well established in Slovenia, especially considering the relative size of the country and the newness of the discipline. Within this context, however, it is possible to see that most research merely borrows and applies concepts and rudimentary studies developed in other countries, primarily in Great Britain. While this development has its own weight and meaning, the Slovenia's cultural situation is specific enough to oblige cultural studies to develop, at least to some degree, a specific research apparatus that could perceive and thematize the distinctive aspects of Slovene culture. The article addresses this possibility and highlights specifics in the Slovene political, cultural, and historical context that could serve as a point of departure for the development of a distinctively Slovene cultural studies practice. This article identifies four basic conditions: Slovene culture is actually an intersection of cultures; culture occupies a special symbolic place in Slovene public life; the experience of a successful communist revolution; and the powerful influence of the punk movement.},

  abstract = {In the years since Cobb and Elder (1971) advanced agenda building as an alternative structural perspective to the normatively appealing, yet realistically untenable, democratic theory, the agenda-building framework has been applied somewhat sporadically and inconsistently in at least three types of studies: (a) those that analyze reciprocity and interchange among policymakers, mass media and mass publics; (b) those that position media content as an independent measure, as in the case of investigative reporting; and (c) those that examine influences on media content, as in analyses of information subsidies and presidential communications. Tracing the conceptual origins of agenda building and reviewing relevant scholarship in mass communication, political science, and sociology, the present article seeks to clarify conceptual terminology. As indicators of direction-specific research, the terms policy agenda building, media agenda building, and public agenda building, adapted from Rogers and Dearing (1988), stand to add both clarity and consistency to the scholarly literature. Additionally, with the continued influence of Internet communication, the author suggests that scholarship might be enhanced with consistent use of the term intermedia agenda building, as explained in the article.},

  abstract = {The English-language research tradition of studying media events is widely considered to have started with Dayan and Katz' Media Events. This seminal work is characterised by an emphasis on liveness and broadcast technology as conditions of eventfulness. The German-language tradition of research on historical media events provides a very different approach to studying media events, starting from the 16th-century advent of mechanical production and distribution. Bringing together these strands of research, the article argues for a deepening of the historical dimension in conceiving of media events. After a critical review of the English-language tradition and an overview of key media-historical research contributions particularly from Germany, it discusses three main themes: the role of temporal acceleration over time by means of media technologies; the role of premeditation in events and the tradition of discussing media-generated events as 'pseudo-events', and the historically shifting relationships between mediated and non-mediated communication in the event. By way of conclusion, the article relates a historical perspective on media events to recent research and discussion around mediatisation.},

Groundbreaking, because she paved new trajectories in the study of popular communication and applied pioneering qualitative research methods to media studies. Toward the end of the 1970s, when only few perceived that popular culture was a legitimate field of inquiry and even fewer believed that interpretative efforts in the spirit of the humanities were worth institutionalizing in the social sciences, it was Tamar who swam against the stream and completed a pioneering study on the reception of the American soap opera Dallas among members of different cultural communities. Her book The Export of Meaning: Cross-Cultural Readings of Dallas (co-authored with Elihu Katz) soon became canonic and is still being taught in introductory media studies courses around the world. Fearless, because the same road Tamar paved to establish these lines of research and, indeed, to revolutionize the field of communication, was also rife with rivalries, battles, and struggles she never hesitated to engage in. Tamar was the white knight who never feared fighting the dragons, and in some cases (though not all) she even won.},

Both before and after World War II, academic training for the profession of journalism versus on-the-job apprenticeship system of ?learning by doing? became a frequent dilemma and controversial topic. Beyond a comparative study of the state of the art in different countries, we attempt to show how the so-called ?American model? in journalism education was viewed from Europe and vice versa. As a result, some conclusions about the accuracy or distortion of those views are reached. Special emphasis is placed on the origins of some misconceptions resulting from certain oversimplifications rooted on both sides of the Atlantic.},

As a whole, these studies draw upon different conceptualizations, employ inconsistent operationalizations, and give short shrift to imintportant macroscopic variables. Such inconsistencies potentially account for substantial prointportions of the variance in spiral of silence effects. This paper examines these three areas in greater detail. First, we review key assumptions and theoretical statements of the spiral of silence. Second, we examine how these conceptual issues translate into operational ones. Finally, we outline areas that have remained largely unexplored over the last 25 years. Specifically, we contend that spiral of silence studies in different cultures have failed to take into account culture-specific variables that may mitigate the imintportance of opinion perceptions as predictors of individual behavior or attitudes. In other words, cross-cultural differences are key factors in predicting speaking-out, the key dependent variable in spiral of silence research. As a result, we call for the return to a more macroscopic focus in spiral of silence research.},

His advancement of our knowledge about the centrality of the individual in the media uses and effects relationship has inspired numerous scholars to add to the body of knowledge guided by uses and gratifications research. The breadth of Rubin's work in this regard is extraordinary, but his devotion to clarifying central concepts of uses and gratifications in his audience-centered research should also be recognized. Rubin's pioneering studies in uses and gratifications remain as benchmarks for scholars seeking to understand electronic media and how engaged audiences relate to media content.},

There is a conveyor belt of books about new media, but what seems to be missing is knowledge and understanding of the classical media theories of Ernst Cassirer, Susanne Langer, Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, Claude Shannon, Gregory Bateson, Vil m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, and many others. In Understanding Media Theory, the ideas of these theoreticians and philosophers are explained and applied in a clear and accessible way\textendash{}not by discussing the writers one by one, but by using real examples and analyzing them on the basis of concepts developed in media theory. Consequently, this volume is accessible to a broad public, though it is primarily intended for students and teachers of media studies. The main thrust of media theory is the analysis of how a society is altered by the technical characteristics of the various media it encompasses. Media theory therefore examines popular culture as well as the arts, journalism as well as philosophy, scientific as well as general insights, mass media as well as individualized media. Media theory claims to offer an explanation for all historic and social phenomena.},

  abstract = {Scholars have lamented the state of fragmentation in communication scholarship for it undermines its consolidation as a distinct and coherent field of study. My interest in this article is to assess whether this diagnosis applies to communication and media studies in Latin America. My argument is that the field remains united yet fragmented in the region. Unlike communication scholarship in the United States and some European countries, it is grounded in common theoretical and analytical roots laid down in the 1960s and 1970s. Foundational studies produced made original and important contributions to the field at large, most notably, the study of media/cultural imperialism, innovations in communication/media policies, and the intersection between media and cultural dynamics. Since then, the field has become consolidated and expanded with the proliferation of research and universities and the development of various lines of research. The result is the empirical fragmentation of the field in multiple, parallel lines of research. Although fragmentation has produced rich empirical studies on myriad issues, it has yet to produce path-breaking, ambitious arguments that once were distinctive of the '' Latin American'' tradition of communication and media scholarship. What is needed, I argue, is to adopt an analytical position that places theoretical questions at the center, engages with arguments produced in different settings, and participates in broad debates in the global community of communication and media scholars.

This comparison, utilized in a variety of ways over time, originated in the canonical Four Theories of the Press (Siebert et al., 1963[1956]). This juxtaposition, more broadly, uses the Cold War 'Other' to define what western journalism is, or should be, by what it is not. Building on the theoretical insights of Fredrik Barth and Edward Said, this article traces the construction of this 'Other' in the study of western journalism. Ultimately, the author argues that the use of this 'Other' in the construction of a coherent, meaningful definition of western journalism, and in the explication and justification of journalistic practice therein, constitutes a problematic guide in thinking about the development of journalism in nations that were historically part of this 'Other'.},

First, it reviews approaches and contributions by European scholars with records of continuous and cumulative research into political communication, identifying eight common features of their work. A core notion is that of a `political communication system', including its structure (focusing especially on relations between politicians and journalists), the role of media power, the external influences to which it responds in different societies and how it changes. Audience studies are pursued and normative assessments developed within this perspective as well. Second, a few priority areas for future attention are proposed that could lead to a philosophically grounded critical (but non-Marxist) theory of political communication.},

The 87-page, oblong, soft-cover booklet contains bold, semi-abstract, pared-down images accompanied by text, devised (so it declared) to make scientific concepts 'more easily intelligible to the layman'. Produced by UNESCO's Department of Mass Communication, the picture book represents the organization's early-postwar confidence in the power of scientific knowledge as a social remedy and diplomatic tool. In keeping with a significant component of the race campaign, What Is Race? presented genetics as the route to an enlightened, scientific, non-prejudiced understanding of race. This article seeks to explain the book's management, aesthetics and framing in the context of postwar disciplinary and international politics. Viewing UNESCO's race campaign as a high point for an internationalist ideology of mass education, this article also analyses the visual and literary arguments of What Is Race? and proposes that the enduring image of genetics as technical and neutral knowledge was in part shaped by UNESCO's efforts to communicate scientific authority to an apparently 'popular' audience.},

We show that published researches have been studying only a limited set of game genres and that they especially focus on online games. We then expose the different ways game studies are talking about games through a topic model analysis of our corpus.

Since that time, few studies have made significant theoretical contributions. This apparent slowdown is inconsistent with certain trends in the media industries and in the academy that logically should result in greater production of seminal studies. The question is why so few milestones have been produced in recent years? A possible answer is that certain trends are taking place in U.S. society that tend to reduce the number of ground-breaking studies that will be produced by contemporary academics. Specifically, social scientists have turned from media studies to their more traditional research agenda; increasing attention is being paid to qualitative analysis by today's media scholars, and many are now preoccupied with critical perspectives rather than research.

With an eye towards contemporary media problems, this project aims to recuperate lost alternatives and yield fresh insights regarding the institutional role of the press in a modern democratic society. By situating the Hutchins Commission in a historical trajectory of media criticism and media reform movements, this paper illuminates perennial tensions and confrontations between the liberal ideals and commercial imperatives driving the US press system. Drawing from Gramscian theory to contextualize the US media system's current crisis, the paper concludes by outlining an emergent consensus that calls for structural reform and for re-evaluating core normative democratic principles underpinning the social contract between US media institutions and the public.},

@article{fordham_subversive_2016,
  abstract = {This article situates the work of American press critic George Henry Seldes within the broader muckraking traditions in order to consider the ways in which he sustained critical and investigative journalism practices during the 1930s and 1940s. Seldes's journalism is compared with the early twentieth-century muckraking movement associated with national magazines, which positioned journalists as national cultural entities concerned with the common good and able to shape public opinion and political action through their investigations of government and business wrongdoing. An examination of Seldes's critiques and a review of the reception to his work reveal how the corporatization of the press and advances in technology transformed muckraking journalism. Muckrakers continued to use investigative techniques to highlight injustice and justify reform, but Seldes's work demonstrates that those who crusaded too vehemently ran the danger of violating standards of impartiality and objectivity and having their work cast as radical and subversive.},

It does this by examining the teaching programmes that have been generated by various formations of convergence culture: programmes in new media studies, creative industries and digital media studies. The results of this examination are cause for concern: most of these programmes appear to have surrendered the space won for Cultural Studies in the university curriculum in favour of an instrumentalist focus on the training, rather than the education, of personnel to work in the emerging media industries. The essay argues therefore that while such developments may represent themselves as emerging from within Cultural Studies, in practice they have turned out to have very little to do with Cultural Studies at all.},

  abstract = {Harold Adams Innis's A History of Communication has attained almost mythological status within his oeuvres and is widely recognized as an important repository of his ideas. Yet the work (numbering 2,400 pages) has never been published, and its significance for understanding Innis's scholarship has yet to be assessed. This article examines why a number of efforts to publish the work met with failure, giving particular attention to a venture supported by the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission in 1969-1970 as viewed through the eyes of Mary Quayle Innis and those advising her (particularly Northrup Frye, Donald Innis, and George Ferguson). The article concludes with an overview of the manuscript's contents along with some of the organizing principles that underpinned the empirical material that Innis presents. Such an exercise, the author argues, is essential if one is to address whether the document merits publication in some form},

Early work was mainly on television news journalism in the United Kingdom. It focused on issues relating to the economy and industrial relations and developed new methods of content analysis using a videotaped database. As the work developed new topics were explored, including issues of war and peace media coverage, representations of AIDS, child sexual abuse, bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE: "mad cow disease"), mental health, breast cancer and the communication of risk and the reporting of disasters in Africa. With this extension of topics new methods of research have been used to consider source-journalist relations and reception analysis through the use of focus groups. In this way the attempt has been made to achieve a better understanding of the processes which go to make up the circuit of communication.},

That evolution changed the relationship between news producers and consumers. It broke down the geographical boundaries in defining our communities, and this change forced new organizational and economic models for news and information. This retrospective on twelve years of Convergence and Society conferences devoted to research and practices reveals a set of lessons for journalism educators. Convergence began to encompass multiple dimensions from collaboration across media outlets to the integrated use of multiple media in collecting and delivering information. It has brought about the rise of emerging neo-communities not confined by place. Despite the upheaval from new technologies, mass media in general have successfully adapted. But to keep pace, those who teach and practice journalism and mass communication must implement sustainable innovation.},

Here we trace the historical rise of the critical school, and its contemporary differences in viewing consumer behavior. The critical school tends to be concentrated in Europe, while the empirical school is strongest in the United States. Prospects for greater understanding of the critical school by members of its counterpart are discussed, along with implications of such understanding for consumer researchers.},

  abstract = {Mills wrote to his Oxford publisher in 1955. '' One book grows out of another; the trouble is not only is there no end to it, but after the second is pressing upon you before you can finish the first, for planning is more fun than working.'' 78 Indeed, this mode of working was common to all of Mills' projects. He worked fast and furiously and always juggled a number of different ideas in various stages of formation. This certainly was the case with The Cultural Apparatus. In a 1955 letter to his publisher Mills enthusiastically said of the book '' I'm into it.'' He predicted, optimistically, that unlike his other books, this book would be easy, a natural for him that '' writing it will not involve the anguish that White Collar and Elites have provided.'' By 1959, however, Mills had to admit that this optimism was premature. In '' The Personal Note to the Reader'' he confessed that '' I've never had so much trouble writing a book as I have with this one, and I've never taken so much pain with the writing of it as I've taken to heart the criticism of being repetitious, verbose and prone to jargon.'' 79 Mills never completed the project. By the late 1950's he became preoccupied with the political issues of '' war and peace'' and American foreign policy in Cuba, the latter in particular. His health was poor as a result of a heart attack he suffered in December of 1959 on the eve of a televised debate with an American advisor in Latin America, A.A. Berle. He became embroiled in what he understood as necessary public work from within the media and he remained adamant about the personal significance of The Cultural Apparatus in 1959.},

The most elementary experience in human existence is the irreversibility of the flow of time. Technology provides a means for channeling this irreversibility. Media are practices that use strategies of spatialization to enable one to manipulate the order of things that progress in time by transforming singular events in reproducible data. Human bodies cannot be seen as media because they are subject to the linearity of time. Are media a priori functioning universals for Friedrich Kittler? The answer is: no.

  abstract = {The Cybernetic Apparatus: Media, Liberalism, and the Reform of the Human Sciences examines efforts to reform the human sciences through new forms of technical media. It demonstrates how nineteenth-century political ideals shaped mid-twentieth-century programs for cybernetic research and global science sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. Through archival research and textual analysis, it reconstructs how and why new media, especially digital technologies, were understood as part of a neutral and impartial apparatus for transcending disciplinary, ethnic, regional, and economic differences. The result is a new account of the role of new media technologies in facilitating international and interdisciplinary collaboration (and critique) in the latter half of the twentieth century. Chapter one examines how political conceptions of communications and technology in the United States in the nineteenth century conditioned the understanding and deployment of media in the twentieth century, arguing that American liberals conceived of technical media as part of a neutral apparatus for overcoming ethnic, geographic, and economic difference in the rapidly expanding nation. Chapter two examines the development of new media instruments as technologies for reforming the natural and human sciences from the 1910s through the 1940s, with particular attention to programs administered by the Rockefeller Foundation. Chapters three and four examine the rise, in the 1940s and 1950s, of cybernetics and information theory as an ideal of scientific neutrality and political orderliness. These chapters demonstrate how programs sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, MIT, and other institutions shaped linguist Roman Jakobson's and anthropologist Claude L{\'e}vi-Strauss's efforts to redefine their fields as communication sciences. Chapter five considers how critics of cybernetics, including Noam Chomsky, Claude Shannon, and Roland Barthes, critically re-evaluated the claims of cybernetics to redefine the relations between technical research and the human sciences.},

In the process, I argue (a) that while Dewey largely failed to reconcile his democratic ideal with the empirical constraint of large-scale organizations, Habermas, in particular his work on the public sphere, provides an important starting point for considering the state of public participation within the communication distortions of advanced capitalism; (b) that to fully understand the relation between communication distortions and public participation, social theorists must look beyond Habermas and return to Dewey to mobilize his bi-level view of habitual and reflective human agency; and, finally, (c) that the perspective of a Deweyan political theory of reflective agency best furthers our understanding of potential communication distortions and public participation, particularly in the empirical spaces of media centralization and intellectual property rights.},

  abstract = {In this article, we trace the emergence of film criticism in Australia, from the period of its first appearance in the 1920s to its formalisation in the academy in the 1970s. Through an examination of trade, fan, newspaper and journal publications, we identify along the way four significant moments when broader industrial, public and institutional configurations gave rise to different kinds of film criticism: an 'independent commentary moment' (the 1920s), a 'film as film moment' (1930s), a 'film appreciation moment' (1950s\textendash{}1960s) and a 'production principle moment' (1970s). Each attended to some new way of taking up and being with film and is associated with its own particular array of practices. This historical trajectory of film criticism was characterised by increasing complexity and variety. Rather than replacing or displacing existing forms, each new form of film criticism built upon existing forms, produced new layerings and relations among critical forms. Using Bennett's [Making Culture, Changing Society (Abingdon, 2013), 125.] perspectives on the relation between culture and government, we identify film criticism as a form of expertise for adjudicating films and guiding their uptake. In this way, we show film criticism as being shaped not only by the shifting priorities of film and the film world, but also by broader contingencies of media, education and public culture. This lens reveals an important Australian difference when compared to the US, Britain and continental Europe: the Australian uptake of a film-as-film aesthetics in longer form film writing and reviewing is very much a response to and a consequence of the coming of sound rather than of the late silent period. We end with some remarks on the contribution this national trajectory of film reviewing made to the formation of film writing in the Australian academy and to the revival of Australian film-making, which both began in earnest in the 1970s.},

Its ancestry includes philosophers and social scientists who contributed to the definition of public opinion, which had to be conceptualized before it could be measured. Landowners and social reformers are among those who worked on the methods of social surveys. Journalists, psychologists, and sociologists contributed to the fashioning of questionnaires. Sampling theory was developed by astronomers, mathematicians, and economists, while the methods of data analysis were devised by statisticians, psychologists, and sociologists. All this, when coupled with modern technology, makes polling an indispensable tool of politics, business, and the mass media today.},

@phdthesis{gordon_genesis_1987,
  abstract = {The principal aim of this study is to offer an historical reconstruction of the genesis of radical cultural studies. In practice this project has entailed the construction of a progressively-written account of the intellectual development of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies from the time of its establishment in 1964 and, especially, during the period of the politicisation of its project from the historical conjuncture of 1968 onwards through to the mid-1970s. Integral to the realising of this aim has been the development of an interpretation of the Centre's radical project as having constituted a counter-intellectual critique; that is, and interrelated ensemble of delegitimating, legitimating and reflexive critiques. It will be shown that this interpretation emerges from the Centre's intellectual history over the periods of its development considered and that, in retrospect, it can be discerned in the terms in which the Centre critically transformed its own project. The study begins with a critical consideration of two reconstructive approaches to cultural studies\textendash{}those of historical reconstruction and reconstructive critique. After this point of departure attention is immediately focussed on the originating formulation and the initial reception of the Birmingham Centre's project. This is followed by a chapter devoted to the critical practice of its founder Richard Hoggart. Two chapters on the Centre's engagement with sociology then ensue and this leads to a consideration of the radicalisation of its project which emphasises the turn towards Marxism that it involved. Next the elements of a reconstructive critique of radical cultural studies are presented using the components of a counter-intellectual critique theoretically constructed for this purpose conjoined with a perspective on three kinds of knowledge-constitutive interests. A brief discussion on the derivation and use of the term counter culture is also given. Lastly the study reconsiders reconstructive approaches to cultural studies with special reference to the topic of deep interpretation. The study ends with some reflections on cultural studies and its 'shadow'.},

Past my detailed explication of Luhmann?s key concepts, I register my deep disagreements with his philosophy and speculate about why his treatise may have suffered neglect within EC. Briefly mentioning critical traditionalism, I also suggest alternatives to Luhmann?s theoretical framework. I devote the last section of the paper to my vision for the future of EC.},

  abstract = {The division of the communication discipline according to whether people communicate face-to-face or via a technological medium has shaped the field's development from the outset. The divide has been institutionalized over time in the structures of academic departments and schools, professional training and degrees, scholarly societies and publishing, and in the field's larger research agendas. However, critics inside and outside the field have long insisted that the differences between the two subfields actually obscure the shifting, contingent nature of communication in everyday experience, social formations, and culture. This paper traces efforts to theorize the intersection of interpersonal and media communication, and in particular the concept of mediation, from Lazarsfeld and Katz's two-step flow in the 1950s, to the challenge of digital media technologies in the 1970s and 1980s, to the rise of new media studies and digital culture scholarship from the 1990s onward.},

The five primary findings reveal that: 1) publication of new media research continues to diffuse, with the subfield likely to have reached a critical mass and passed through an adoption 'take off' phase; 2) authors favor a concentrated set of title keyword terms to describe their research; 3) media-oriented journals publish approximately half of all new media articles; 4) a core set of 14 communication-related journals currently publishes new media research; and 5) the principles of mediamorphosis and diffusion of innovations help to explain the emergence of the new media concentration within the communication discipline. We conclude that new media research focusing on the internet and related digital technologies is currently a formalized and self-sustaining area of study within the discipline.},

The paper addresses this convergence-within-divergence by comparing how policy discourses have conceptualised popular culture in the two countries. It investigates the hypothesis that, in both, an engagement with popular culture has in fact been an important driver of change, albeit at different times and with different taxonomies.

From early on in these studies, the figure he wrote about and continued to write about throughout his life was the poet, and fellow Jesuit, Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ong was drawn to Hopkins in large part for the bearing of his writing on the evolution of human consciousness. Ong discovered in his Master's thesis on Hopkins' sprung rhythm \textendash{} written under Marshall McLuhan \textendash{} that Hopkins was in some sense hearing in advance the sounds of what would become twentieth-century modernism. Hopkins displayed a sensibility and awareness that were compelling for the modernist writers of the twentieth century, as they carried out their experiments with finding new voices, new ways of writing poetry for the changed world in which they found themselves. Hopkins' feel for the distinctive self, seeking connection with other selves in the uncertainties of time, played no small role in this appeal.

  abstract = {Media archaeological methods for extending the lifetime of new media into 'old media' have experienced a revival during the past years. In recent media theory, a new context for a debate surrounding media archaeology is emerging. So far media archaeology has been articulated together with such a heterogeneous bunch of theorists as Erkki Huhtamo, Siegfried Zielinski, Thomas Elsaesser and to a certain extent Friedrich Kittler. However, debates surrounding media archaeology as a method seem to be taking it forward not only as a subdiscipline of (media) history, but increasingly into what will be introduced as materialist media diagrammatics. This article maps some recent media archaeological waves in German media theory. The text addresses Wolfgang Ernst's mode of media archaeology and his provocative accounts on how to rethink media archaeology as a fresh way of looking into the use and remediation of media history as a material monument instead of a historical narrative and as a recent media theoretical wave from Germany that seems to not only replicate Kittler's huge impact in the field of materialist media studies but develop that in novel directions. However, as will be argued towards the end, Ernst's provocative take that hopes to distinguish itself as a Berlin brand of media theory in its hardware materiality and time-critical focus resonates strongly with some of the recent new directions coming from US media studies, namely in software and platform studies.},

This article provides one observer's perspective on the evolution of the discipline: literature, theory, and practice. The creation and growth of ISAGA are also referenced. Early computer simulations failed at prediction due to limitations of theory, data, and technology. Their lack of transparency limited their value for expository purposes. Through time, a design methodology has emerged to guide the creation of simulation games to improve communication in complex policy decision environments. These instruments are not intended to be predictive; rather, their primary objective is to help a group achieve consensus through the multilogue mode of communication. Several simulation/games are outlined to illustrate the progression of the discipline.},

The same year JOCAM was launched, an interdisciplinary group of Canadian scholars formed a scholarly association to address the needs of researchers working with young people's texts and cultures across Canada. In this paper, three members of Association for Research in Cultures of Young People's (ARCYP's) Executive examine current and future tensions within children's media studies by drawing on lessons from ARCYP's opening decade. Both ARCYP and JOCAM emerged during a time of productive intersections between the fields of children's studies and media studies. Here, we draw on ARCYP's history as part of an examination of ongoing lacunae that have arisen as sites of common concern have emerged. These tensions\textemdash{}having to do with notions of textuality and authority, consumption and children's agency and citizenship and power\textemdash{}point to lacunae in the field of children's media studies. ARCYP's history of development is thus taken up as a lens to see the past and imagine the future priorities of our research field.},

Such was the case in the relationship between the private, voluntary National Film Society of Canada and the public, state-funded National Film Board of Canada. It was a relationship that demonstrated the fragmentary and incomplete nature of hegemonic discourses. The NFS served a crucial function by coordinating access of films to schools and public life, often on behalf of the NFB. Assisting this coordination was an obscure and short-lived organization, the Canadian Film Committee. The CFC and the NFS helped to tilt the idea of national film projects toward an educational discourse, one that highlighted issues of citizenship over other alternatives for national film culture.},

He hoped to complement the standard histories of sociology that dwell exclusively on social theory with the history of the other, equally important, empirical roots of the discipline. Lazarsfeld thought that institutional support for social research would be more readily forthcoming if the long and interesting history of empirical sociology became better known.},

It analyses in-depth interviews with 14 practitioners and educators in conjunction with Public Relations Institute of Australia (PRIA) archives. Four themes emerged from the analysis: education, professionalisation and gender; theory and practice; developing academic legitimacy and practitioner perspectives in the curriculum. Participants understood education within a professional narrative, that is, as offering a way of establishing Australian public relations as a distinct field of expertise and confirming its professional status. The findings offer new insights into the development of Australian public relations education as it became established as a popular course of study and the role of PRIA in the constitution and transmission of public relations knowledge.},

One of the central contradictions of the Decatur Study is that it simultaneously disguises that it is women who are being studied here yet universalizes them as representative of the general population. But the article also argues that despite the blind spots and ahistoricity of Personal Influence, it was a crucial reminder that women, despite being individual targets of much media fare, were also embedded in social networks through which they influenced other women and were, in turn, influenced by them.},

Our analysis identified five relatively independent research traditions addressing this construct.

We conclude with conceptual and operational recommendations for researchers interested in perspective-taking, highlighting potential areas of investigation that communication scholars are uniquely positioned to explore.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s Perth was probably the most important city in Australia for Cultural Studies. Through that decade many intellectuals who became leaders in Australian Cultural Studies and important players in Cultural Studies outside of Australia worked in Perth. Among them were John Fiske, John Frow, John Hartley, Tom O'Regan, Lesley Stern, Graeme Turner and, a decade later, Ien Ang. This essay discusses the presence of these academics in Perth and advances some reasons why Perth became so important to Cultural Studies in Australia. It also discusses the kind of Cultural Studies that became privileged in Perth and considers some of the reasons for this. Perth Cultural Studies in the 1980s was primarily text-based and focused on screen-related popular culture, especially television programs and popular film. Cultural Studies in Perth developed in a city thought of as marginal to Australia, in institutions that were either not universities or, in the case of Murdoch University, was a very new university, by cosmopolitan academics who mostly came from either elsewhere in Australia or from the United Kingdom.},

  abstract = {Harold Adams Innis (1894-1952) and Herbert Marshall McLuhan (1911- ), as encyclopedic weavers of perception, are the proper parents of Canadian intellectual history and communications study. Despite their respective specialized backgrounds in political economy and English literature, Innis and McLuhan approached the inter-disciplinary terra incognita of 'communications' during World War II and the immediate years which followed. Having chosen the antithetical academic traditions of Cambridge University humanities and the University of Chicago social sciences, the two thinkers first published contrary philosophies in The Dalhousie Review of 1936. More than a decade later the young Professor McLuhan was to request from Dean Innis a grant to cover publishing fees. By 1948 the two explorers were to converge upon each other and upon the same subject matter\textendash{}advertising and newspapers\textendash{}from differing political, academic, and religious views. Despite the infrequency of their discussion and correspondence, each man's thinking was significantly influenced by his colleague. A number of important Toronto academics joined Innis and McLuhan in the interdisciplinary 'Values Group' seminars of 1949. Following Innis' death in 1952, McLuhan uniquely treated Innis' major themes and interpolated a synthesis of other thinkers with his own topical perceptions. The boyhood backgrounds of Innis and McLuhan reveal striking similarities such as talented and industrious mothers and fundamentalists values. Yet the outstanding differences in age, disposition, experience, and method render these 'two men on a collision course' most unlikely co-creators. Innis' hidden tradition of dialectics, as opposed to McLuhan's chosen tradition of rhetorical grammar, posits the primacy of materialism, realism, and empiricism. McLuhan, conversely, must be understood within the tradition of spiritual, satirical, and oratorical aesthetics. The multi-disciplinary methodology of each man is unique. Nevertheless, there exists sufficient parallel between the two appoaches to speak of an Innis-McLuhan effect in popular thinking. The themes and appoaches common to Innis and McLuhan make possible a new understanding of specialized fields: Chapter Ten offers a streamlined model of how such a perspective might be applied to the study of drama and cinema. The underlying biases of Innis and McLuhan are part truth and part opinion. Men create technology and not technology men. Nevertheless, the staples thesis of Innis, transformed by McLuhan into 'the medium is the message,' has numerous valuable implications and applications. In Chapters One and Two, mere appetizers, the 'unknown' personalities of Innis and McLuhan as informal human beings behind their more formal images are introduced. In Chapters Three and Four, their formative years of training are placed within the larger context of Canadian cultural change and global technological transformation. The contributions of Innis and McLuhan to their fields of specialty are simplified in Chapters Four and Five. In Chapters Five and Six the actual Innis-McLuhan collision and the birth of communications studies are introduced while in Chapter Seven McLuhan's debt to Innis and independent development in the 1960's is explored. Chapter Eight is essentially a condensation of and commentary upon the thought of Harold Innis as is Chapter Nine a cataloging and clarifying of McLuhan's dominant probes. The summary chapter provides a scrutiny of the implications, applications, and veracity of each man's thought.},

In his early work, he focused on political elites' manipulation of an ignorant public through the deployment of symbolism. In his later work, however, he suggested that even elites are the puppets of their ideologies. His early work has been well received; his later work has gone largely unremarked.The reason may have to do with the very thing that Edelman was, in his later work, addressing: the (populist) ideological biases of his politically elite (academic) audience.},

Furthering Leeds-Hurwitz (2010) frame for analyzing people, places, and ideas in each decade, L{\"o}blich and Scheu's (2010) model is applied and extended to consider six domains for profiling a field: (\#1) people\textemdash{}the biographies of influencers, (\#2) places\textemdash{}their institutions/networks, (\#3) ideas\textemdash{}their intellectual propositions, (\#4) events\textemdash{}influential gatherings and associations, (\#5) times\textemdash{}influential periods, paradigms, Zeitgeist, and (\#6) contexts\textemdash{}multiple levels of other situated influences. The proposed six analysis areas seek to adopt 0065, 0070 and 0075 for examining the intersections of social history for a discipline, especially one as interdisciplinary in its origins and applications as intercultural communication (IC). Each is applied with proposals and starting profile suggestions for carrying out multimodal mapping of the intercultural fields. Two other potential frames are also considered: a possible (\#7) behavior\textemdash{}the personal/social applications of the field (e.g., to intercultural training), and (\#8) consequences\textemdash{}the social impacts and responses to the field.

The present article takes issue with her analysis, arguing that the field is not in crisis, but has made impressive strides in answering media effects questions and explaining influences of media on different levels. Elaborating on how the Kuhnian paradigm-in-crisis model does not accurately describe the current state of mass communication research, this article discusses the role that the time-honored media effects narrative plays in the discipline, positive aspects of Lang's vision, and conceptual issues to consider in efforts to theorize about the constantly-changing communication environment.},

  abstract = {Purpose - In the annals of marketing history and the history of marketing thought, there is a key figure whose influence from the mid-twentieth century through to the present day is worthy of note, Dr Ernest Dichter. The purpose of this paper is to place Dichter's writings in appropriate context and posit that arguably more insight into this charismatic figure can be discerned by taking greater account of the Cold War (1946-1991) climate in which he was working and writing. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is best thought of as an example of biographically inflected research. The paper focuses on the "socially progressive" aspect of his writings in order to display Dichter's support for the American economic system in the Cold War climate of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The author highlights how Dichter came to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the mid-1950s. What this paper underscores above and beyond all those that have explored aspects of Dichter's life is that his character was interpreted by respondents to FBI questioning in ways that reflected geopolitical circumstance. Findings - Some of those interviewed by the Bureau praised him highly, whilst others labelled him a Communist, and accused his organisation of employing people with similar leanings. While Dichter may have had some limited associations with socialist doctrines in his early youth, such accusations were misplaced. But, overall, what this paper highlights is a highly malleable practitioner whose practices and writings both contributed to the society in which they were disseminated, but also shifted with the circumstances in which they circulated. Originality/value - This paper adds an important dimension to the biography of Ernest Dichter which has not previously been explored.},

  abstract = {The following proposal for an MA and Ph.D. programme at the University of California, Davis, is the culmination of four years of meetings and other organizing activities focused on the formal institutionalization of cultural studies at UC Davis. Groundwork for the proposed cultural studies programme began in a series of discussions held by an interdisciplinary group of faculty about how to create the opportunity for structured graduate teaching, advising and research in cultural studies at UC Davis. The Dean of Graduate Studies at that time encouraged this group to submit a pre-proposal for an MA and Ph.D. in cultural studies. Faculty involved in the original discussions subsequently drew up a pre-proposal and held further informal meetings. E-mail lists were created and information was disseminated. Eventually, an executive committee, whose charge it was to draw up a formal proposal, was formed. The following proposal grew out of the executive committee's early efforts. Cultural studies at UC Davis cuts across myriad units, programmes, clusters and centres in two colleges in the humanities, social sciences, and agricultural environmental studies and involves a unique collectivity of faculty and students interested in class, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, transnationalism, postcolonialism and related areas of enquiry. The UC Davis proposal, therefore, forges many connections across a wide variety of cultural studies interests.},

I argue that these approaches have indirectly silenced a much longer disciplinary history outside '' the West'' that has not only produced empirical knowledge but has also actively challenged Western epistemologies. This article seeks to reinscribe the epistemological and historical foundations of media and communication studies in Africa. By framing the research of African media and communication scholars within the changing nature of knowledge production, shifting power relations between African nations, and the evolving role of African universities, I demonstrate how academic knowledge production is frequently driven and constrained by particular dominant social, political, and economic interests.},

Personal experiences as a founding member of the Centre are drawn on to explore the evolution of CS's methodology and its analytical dissection of racism in English culture. It is shown that CS's difficulty in analyzing race lies in the absences and displacement with which Western culture simultaneously perpetuates and dissimulates racial meanings, and positions subjects. The mission of CS, it is concluded, is to mobilize its intellectual resources to understand the differences that lie at the core of our cultures and ourselves.},

After a brief biographical introduction, the author examines five fields of significance pertinent to Apel's thought and to the study of communication: First is Apel's work on the so-called understanding and explanation controversy, or Erklaeren-verstehen (E-V) in German; second is Apel's theory of discourse ethics; third, there are a series of essays through which the readers also get a fuller account of Apel's use of Charles Sanders Peirce's pragmatic approach to philosophy; and fourth, there are several articles' that reflect Apel's contributions to global politics based on his transcendental pragmatic framework. Finally, there is a lengthy discussion of a few other areas of significance that reveals Apel's conceptual relationship to theories of communication. The first of these areas or fields consists of the way in which Apel takes up hermeneutics. The second is his definition and use of the '' self-recuperative principle'' while the third consists of his ongoing conversations with social philosophers J{\"u}rgen Habermas and Enrique Dussel.},

Though perhaps less well-known internationally than some of his colleagues, he was a pioneer in communication science and mass psychology and has contributed much to the international exchange of information and research among scholars in our field of studies. After 1945, one of his major efforts was to re-establish contacts that had been lost because of the war. Gazette, the international journal that he founded in 1955, was intended to serve these different purposes. Since then Gazette has continued to act as a liaison centre for research and researchers from different parts of the world. Its scope may have widened considerably, both in choice of subjects and in a geographical sense - reflecting the developments in our discipline and the scientific interests of successive editors - still through the years the journal has remained true to the scientific and humanistic aims of its founder.},

After a biographical sketch with an emphasis on the larger historical contexts in which Mumford's scholarship is located, this analysis focuses on three aspects of Mumford's voluminous work that has contributed to the foundations of media ecology: his epochal historiography of technology, the techno-organicism in his thinking about technology and human development, and his critique of the megamachine. The essay concludes with a discussion of the ecological ethics inherent in Mumford's work, his life, and the activism embedded in his media ecology.},

In stages that mirrored those of the profession, educators brought forward gender concerns, to have them addressed in ad hoc fashion by their national association. The women engaged in two decades of committee activism to gain decision-making power at a national level and to open the door for the next generation of feminist media scholarship. This article charts the issues that women educators faced and the actions they pursued as the Committee on the Status of Women (1972-1990). Tracing the development of this Committee points to the progress brought about by women journalism educators as they strove to gain a voice in national affairs. Likewise, it reflects women's standing and their struggles for recognition across the profession.},

Findings also identify five gaps in current OPR research such as idealized propositions based on mutual benefits, a lack of research on multi-party relationships, problematic '' trust'' as the measurement, unilateral self-reported research data, and dominated cross-sectional methods By drawing contingency theory of accommodation and the relationship management theory, this study proposes the concept of contingent organization-public relationship (COPR) for future studies that seek to explore variations of OPR longitudinally.},

Results revealed an increasing productivity especially from Asia-based scholars and the popularity on topics concerning public diplomacy. The analysis also indicated that most articles were theory-driven and survey was the most frequently used method. Experimentation and advanced statistical analyses have been gaining momentum as well. Implications of these findings were discussed with the goal to shed some light on the trends and directions of this maturing discipline in a continent with emerging economies and growing global influence.},

Based on these patterns, as well as on informal input from colleagues, we map the discipline formation of visual studies and identify trends in institutional development.

Predictions made about mass communication research in the 1990s were tested. We found that qualitative research methods continued to be much less common than quantitative methods throughout the period. Funding for research was relatively rare, with the university becoming the main source and private support decreasing significantly in the 1990s. The implications of such trends are discussed.},

Relatively constant influences have included (a) a strong tendency among scholars to social involvement, facilitating normative approaches, (b) a debate over general theoretical issues, and (c) long-standing funding support from RAI (the Italian broadcasting company), concerned to evaluate its public service objectives. Shifts over time from critical theory to more pragmatic perspectives and from reliance on content analysis techniques to a distinctively Italian semiotic approach to media texts are traced. More recent influences have included the unregulated explosion of private commercial television and a keen interest in studying audience reception.},

Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews, based in part on the 'Life-Line' and 'Time-line' techniques developed by Dervin and her collaborators. Participants were purposefully sampled to reflect a range of experience levels and conceptual approaches.. Analysis The study adopted an inductive approach to data analysis, based on the 'constant comparison' approach of Glaser and Strauss. Feedback from participants was sought throughout the analysis process via email. Results 'Interactions and Relationships' describes the social contacts involved in their construction of the author; 'The Role of Existing Constructions' deals with participants' existing knowledge and understandings; and 'Accepted and Contested Constructions' demonstrates how they drew on their existing constructions in order to accept or contest the constructions of the author conveyed to them Conclusions Participants' constructive processes involved drawing on their previous experience ('existing constructions') in order to accept or contest the constructions of the author conveyed to them in each new encounter. Participants' constructive processes had two interdependent aspects: the construction of meaning and the construction of authority.},

A model composed of two dimensions\textemdash{}type of reality and distance of social elements from direct experience\textemdash{}is developed. Studies of the media and the social construction of reality are classified and discussed according to the model. The authors suggest that a holistic approach, as defined in this article, is the best suited perspective for a more complete understanding of the role of the mass media in the process of the social construction of reality, and for the integration of the two schools of communication research.},

The first section maps the origins of the field, specifically the development of the ecological metaphor. The second section explores the metaphor by including the concepts of evolution, interface, and hybridization in the media ecology discourse. The concept of evolution creates a theoretical framework for studying the history of media and suggests new concepts and questions about media extinction, survival, and coevolution. The concept of interface focuses on the media, subject, and social interactions. Finally, the analysis of media hybridizations is basic for understanding the appearance of new media that combine different devices, languages, and functions.},

I argue that the media effects tradition was born into a milieu that was exclusively sided with the nurture (environmental determinist) position and has largely remained so. Within the past 20 years, there have been advances in neurophysiology leading other disciplines to theorize that human behavior is the result of the interaction between nature (genetics, brain physiology) and nurture (learning, culture). In this article, I sample the media effects research emerging from this perspective and argue why this approach is superior to the learning-only approach currently popular in the field of communication. I then discuss the implications of such an approach for communication researchers, framing the critique in terms of the contribution to mass communication theory building.},

@article{van_cuilenburg_media_2003,
  abstract = {This article deals with communications and media policy paradigms. In the US and Western Europe three paradigmatic phases of communications and media policy may be distinguished: the paradigm of emerging communications industry policy (until the Second World War); the paradigm of public service media policy (1945-1980/90); and the current phase (from 1980/90 onwards) in which a new policy paradigm is searched for. In Phase I, communications and media policy primarily referred to the emerging technologies of telegraph, telephony and wireless. Communications policy in that era was mainly pursued for reasons of state interest and financial corporate benefits. After the Second World War, media policy was dominated by sociopolitical rather than economic or national strategic concerns. In this paradigmatic phase, lasting until 1980/90, the ideal of public service broadcasting was at its height, notably in Western Europe. From 1980 onwards, however, technological, economic and social trends fundamentally changed the context of media policy. In many countries, governments opted for policies of breaking monopolies in media and communications and privatizing as much as possible. The old normative media policies have been challenged and policy-makers are searching for a new communications policy paradigm. In this new paradigm, there seems to be a shift in the balance of component political, social and economic values that shape the definition of the public interest that media and communications supposedly serve. The authors conclude by sketching the core principles of the new communications policy paradigm that currently seems to be emerging.},

Properly understood, confidence is a communal process, 'faith-together.' Though typically blamed for encouraging cynicism, mass media also have a very basic tendency to generate public confidence. Status conferral embeds the social objects portrayed by media in webs of value and thus recommends those objects as grounds for public confidence. At the same time, as empirical work has shown, some forms of news undo the work of status conferal and generate cynicism instead, I end by examining distinct structures of civil society that may determine the contours of mediated confidence and cynicism.},

He collapsed notions of community and the public and bracketed the politics of meaning-making at the local level. Consequently, his theory takes the politics out of local community, where identities are formed and political issues identified. Dewey's explanation of democracy as both associated life in the local community and a form of government that grows from it offers a better political vision for a theory of communication.},

The following pages will first explain the reasons behind these overlooking, taking advantage of the gamification debate to compare the actual theories on the relationship between games and society, subsequently recalling Caillois' position, pointing out analogies and differences between the present and past stances. Secondly, this article will discuss the reasons to introduce the thought of Caillois in the current debate, showing compatibility between his theories and contemporary reflections, suggesting the possibility to use them to understand gamification, by observing the long-term analogies between games and societies and the role performed by mimicry.},

  abstract = {Molefi Kete Asante is one of the most important scholars in the field of communication studies in the late twentieth century. His general interests range from intercultural communication, rhetoric, media and public communication to Africana studies. He has taught at several universities, led several organizations and is recognized as a leader within the communication discipline and in the broader national and global society; especially within Africa and the African diaspora. Asante is credited with the development and eventual emergence of what is referred to as the Afrocentric Idea, a theoretical perspective focusing on the agency of African peoples. Asante's groundbreaking work in the 1970s and 1980s would foreshadow and frame many of the debates of not only communication studies, but in the fields of education, sociology, literary, and cultural studies, as well as history from the 1990s and early twenty first century. The current article focuses on Asante's important contributions to intercultural communication in the areas of rhetoric, media and public communication, Africana Studies, and intercultural/interracial communication. Asante's emergence corresponded with the American multiracial struggle against domestic racism and segregation; and the international fight against imperialism and advanced stages of colonialism. Many of Asante's ideas reflect the spirit of the 1955 Bandung conference that helped launch intellectual and political opposition to oppression by people of color. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The psychological, social, and physical processes of human communication. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A communication exchange between multiple cultures. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The influence of media technology, politics, and consumer behavior. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} An analysis of the social, linguistic, and conditions of discourse. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The transgenerational and transcontinental study of Africans. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A theory of social change.},

As such, it has drawn attention to two important matters-first, the fact that the academic discourse is only one among many conversational styles in which we are able to talk about the world, and, second, the role of lived experience, which previously lacked credence as a source of knowledge, but which can now be accessed for theory building. Together, these liberating practices enable scholars to include themselves and their experiences in explaining why and how they perform their intellectual work. This paper analyzes the reasons for the marginalization of feminist thought in the interdisciplinary area of communication studies and elucidates the potential contributions of this approach to social communication theorizing.},

According to Edelman, beneath an apparently functional and accountable democratic state lies a symbolic system that renders an ignorant public quiescent.The state, the media, civil society, interpersonal relations, even popular art are part of a mass spectacle kept afloat by empty symbolic beliefs. However suggestive it is, the weaknesses of Edelman's theoretical and methodological approach, and the relative strengths of more recent research on the politics of cultural symbols, render Edelman's work unable to serve as either model or springboard for the contemporary study of political symbols.},

I examine how women of the third wave, raised on television, have come to define our identities by the presence of a man, due in part to the limited, heteronormative media choices available to young women today.

This is partly because Mills never pretended academic work wasn't personal; his texts pay witness to the struggles of a man who used the written word to come to terms with himself. Mills aimed to grasp it all, to make individual troubles accessible by redefining them into social issues; he failed as much as he succeeded. I make Mills a comrade on my own intellectual journey and argue that rereading Mills allows young critical scholars to rethink current social theory and their own place within it.

This critical narrative reveals that the technocooperativity of the culture market demands that Cultural Studies leave aside knowledge of the negativity of the splitted, the errant and the lost. It corresponds to art and literature, to critical thinking, to reintroduce ? in a minor key ? the disorders of the unclassifiable in the world of the classified and the classifier. Only with the critical play of disobedient languages against the university technomarket can the resigned homology between the politics of governability, the administration of the social, the industrialization of the cultural and the professionalization of useful knowledge be bankrupted.},

Significantly, although Huxley's target was Stalinism when he wrote the novel, revisiting Brave New World forces one to reflect on contemporary, democratic versions of totalitarianism as well. And yet Huxley himself did not follow the political and ethical consequences of his critique. The article seeks to map these consequences by rethinking the maxims of the brave new world in relation to three main themes: biopolitics, nihilism and network society. Indeed, seen through this conceptual prism, there is a remarkable homology between Huxley's Brave New World and our world.},

By ?theory of ethnography?; I refer to the set of theoretical propositions used to define ?what is ethnography?;, both by Hymes and other anthropologists. The paper will first set a contrast between two major variations in Hymes? writing on the subject. An explanation will then be suggested for what appears to be a shift in Hymes? concerns. Finally, a few questions will be raised about the pertinence of Hymes? present position.},

Concepts in titles of papers presented to the Division were analyzed for trends over a 21-year period. Cluster analysis was used to classify concepts on the basis of their linear trend, variability in trend, and annual frequency. Six clusters of trends emerged from the analysis. The content of the increasing clusters, contrasted with decreasing clusters, suggests movement toward the study of cognitive concepts and away from behavioral studies. The analysis also indicates a trend toward theory-driven research that examines the general processes of communication and away from more media-focused examinations that concentrate on specific systems, media, or technologies.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the origins of the institutional organization and advocacy strategies that later culminated in American public broadcasting. Previous to the Communications Act of 1934, which privatized American broadcasting, educational radio lacked standards for best practices and functioned in a decentralized and localized form. After the Act, the Office of Education (OOE) took interest in radio as a medium to expand federal initiatives related to educational ?public forums,? town-hall style meetings centered around community debate. Noting the lack of noncommercial channels in which to broadcast forums to a larger audience, the OOE began to collaborate with the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) to lobby the FCC, while producing civic programming with commercial broadcasters. Instead of fighting the regulation, the OOE and NAEB founded an advocacy approach centered on creating an alternate broadcasting infrastructure as a way to address regulatory precedents. In this process, early forms of production, distribution, and infrastructure later associated with public broadcasting were devised out of a hybrid of commercial broadcasting aesthetics and federal educational bureaucracy. Contrary to the received view, discussion of the origins of American public broadcasting must be framed as advocacy to change the national system through strategies of research, collaboration, and governmental incorporation instead of resistance.},

This article first provides an overview of Innis's two main fields, his staples thesis of Canadian economic development, and media thesis as it concerns world history. This section also relates the media thesis to contemporary media and dependency theories and postmodernist discourses. The second focus of the article is on Innis's critical analysis of press systems. The discussion not only integrates his staples and media theses, buy also extrapolates Innis's analysis to the present to show the deep concerns he would express regarding the present-mindedness of contemporary media and culture. Throughout there is an emphasis on Innis's materialist understanding of culture and social relations.},

We have evaluated the scientific work of Maletzke, biographical material, contemporary witness accounts and protocols of several interviews with Maletzke and some of his peers. The analysis of this material has confirmed the interdependence between the evolution of theories, discipline and the media and the importance of reviewing a scientific study in the context of the biography of its author and the structures of science, which should be applicable to many\textemdash{}local and global\textemdash{}figures in the history of communication science.},

  abstract = {This article presents an analysis of several instances of theorizing across distinct media in the writings of three of the most prominent thinkers in German film theory, B{\'e}la Bal{\'a}zs, Rudolf Arnheim, and Walter Benjamin. Against the common identification of the project of classical film theory with commitment to essentialist notions of medium specificity, the article demonstrates the theorists' concern with intermedial issues of exchanges between film and other media. Drawing on examples from the engagement with the newly emergent medium of radio in canonical texts by the three theorists, the article discusses the influence of radio on theorizing about the unique properties of film, its aesthetic possibilities, and course of development. The article finally argues that the vast dynamic changes in the mediascape of the 1920s and 1930s, which saw the coming of sound film, the emergence of radio, and the first demonstrations of television technology, necessitated classical film theorists to adopt intermedial perspectives similar to those that are commonplace in today's writings on digital cinema and new media.},

Then, on the basis of Mulvey's latest book, Death 24\texttimes{} a Second, and of a variety of contemporary examples, the emphasis is on the relative shift in Mulvey's work from gender to time and visual technology. Finally, the conversation focuses on the concept of 'gendered scopic regime' and the potential re-articulation of the male gaze through the technological re-direction and control of the visual.},

  abstract = {While 'cultural studies is caught in a traffic jam', at the same time the seemingly global crisis of cultural studies coincides with the late reception and high popularity of cultural studies in the German-speaking countries after the 'cultural' and the 'linguistic turns'. Yet, the political and academic history and the contexts of the emergence of cultural studies and 'Kulturwissenschaften', as well as their by now established academic traditions and the manifold relations to current developments, are rarely defined and scrutinized. In this paper,we will relate some theoretical and historical perspectives concerning the relationship between cultural studies and the historical disciplines in the German-speaking context. We shall try to trace the potential of mutual benefits between cultural studies and history by foregrounding the political commitment of academic work that still seems to be one of the most important traits of CS as much as the necessity of a stronger notion of the contextualization that history and historiographical methodology provides.},

At the same time, the globalization of media combined with the globalization of higher education means that the research and teaching of the subject faces immediate and profound challenges, not only as the subject of enquiry but also as the means by which researchers and students undertake their studies.Edited by a leading scholar of global communication, this collection of essays by internationally-acclaimed scholars from around the world aims to stimulate a debate about the imperatives for internationalizing media studies by broadening its remit, including innovative research methodologies, taking account of regional and national specificities and pedagogic necessities warranted by the changing profile of students and researchers and unprecedented growth of media in non-Western world.Transnational in its perspectives, Internationalizing Media Studies is a much-needed guide to the internationalization of media and its study in a global context.},

  abstract = {Deleuze's cinema books are often understood as adopting a Bergsonian framework while rejecting phenomenological accounts of film experience for equating 'cinematographic perception' with 'natural perception'; or, alternatively, simply as being a phenomenological inquiry. Reading Deleuze's comments on, and references to, phenomenology in the cinema books (especially Merleau-Ponty, Laffay, and Dufrenne), this paper argues that while not following a phenomenological logic in general, at certain moments the cinema books' Bergsonian account intersects with phenomenology. Moreover, in the books, the existence of movement-images in the cinema depends on the spectator's experience of watching films. The logic explaining this encounter is indebted to the account of the experience of art and cinema in phenomenology which Deleuze combines with the discussion of 'real' movements in Bergson's Creative Evolution. This reliance on a specific 'passive' viewer's experience can explain the books' limited interest in early cinema and in television, video, and the digital image.},

Walter Thompson ?made sense* from the standpoint of the actors involved. At the time Watson joined the agency, he had achieved a national reputation as a psychologist, a researcher, and the leader of behaviorist psychology. His doctrine, which recognized prediction and control as the goal of psychology, meshed well not only with broader Progressive concerns of social control, but more particularly with the goals of the business community, and at J. Walter Thompson, with the goals of Stanley B. Resor. Watson's presence at the agency became a *mechanism* through which Resor could implement his philosophy into advertising practice. Watson's work was to help rationalize the advertising process, but at the same time, spoke directly to the admirers of science, legitimating a reality in which decision making based upon *scientific* methods assumed a role of prominence.},

Hall (1959), the American anthropologist who wrote The Silent Language and founded the field of intercultural communication, exchanged over 133 letters during the period between 1962 and 1976. Their correspondence provides insight into the evolution of such important ideas as the conception of the media as extensions of man, media technological determinism, and McLuhan's dictum that the medium is the message. Although these ideas are usually attributed to McLuhan, who wrote about them in two important books, The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) and Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1965), Hall had considerable influence in their development. Although Harold Innis is widely acknowledged for shaping McLuhan as a communication technological determinist, the exchange between Hall and McLuhan helped develop the latter's theory about the impacts of communication technology on the human senses. Here we see how important intellectual ideas often grow out of communication between scholars, allowing them to test and extend their thinking in a collaborative mode.},

  abstract = {Keith Rayner's many contributions to the study of reading are reviewed. Topics include eye movements, word recognition, and sentence and discourse processing. Additional topics include scene processing and the E-Z Reader model. Rayner's legacy and the impact he had on students and colleagues are described. Keith Rayner's extraordinary scientific career revolutionized the field of reading research and had a major impact on almost all areas of cognitive psychology. In this article, we review some of his most significant contributions. We begin with Rayner's research on eye movement control, including the development of paradigms for answering questions about the perceptual span and its relationship to attention, reading experience, and linguistic variables. From there we proceed to lexical processing, where we summarize Rayner's work on effects of word frequency, length, predictability, and the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Next, we turn to syntactic and discourse processing, covering the well-known garden-path model of parsing and briefly reviewing studies of pronoun resolution and inferencing. The next section shifts from language to visual cognition and reviews research which makes use of eye movement techniques to investigate object and scene processing. Next, we summarize Rayner and colleagues' approach to computational modeling, with a description of the E-Z Reader model linking attention and lexical processing to eye movement control. The final section discusses the issues Rayner and his colleagues were focused on most recently and considers how Rayner's legacy will continue into the future.},

  abstract = {As the popular narrative has it, the modern speech discipline in the United States was born out of a concern for democracy and reason. However, this story occludes other, decidedly undemocratic, foundational ideas that were at the heart of rhetoric and oratory during the first half of the twentieth century. Given contemporary concerns with both deliberative democracy and affect theory, rhetoricians and speech teachers would benefit today from a fuller understanding of some of the undemocratic ideas that influenced the modern rhetorical renaissance. This article helps accomplish this by focusing on the work of Gustave Le Bon, whose concern with persuasion and the masses was influential on early scholars of rhetorical oratory, including James Winans, William Brigance, and James O?Neill. Indeed, it was Gustave Le Bon who popularized the notion that the masses were like a psychological crowd devoid of reason and the ability to deliberate.},

I argue that liberal feminism, which characterizes much U.S. mainstream media research, speaks only to white, heterosexual, middle and upper class women and is incapable of addressing most women's concerns. Radical and structuralist feminist communication scholars, however, tend to focus exclusively on texts and often ignore important contextual considerations. I conclude that socialist feminism offers the greatest potential for a comprehensive framework to address women's devaluation in communication but that much more theoretical and empirical work still needs to be done. Finally, I encourage the recent tendency among feminist communication scholars to ignore disciplinary boundaries and draw freely on literary, film, and speech studies, as well as mass communication and feminist theory.},

First the evolution of the field since the 1950s is reviewed through a number of stages, which coincide with the history of leftist thinking \textendash{} six ferments, one for each decade. Then the disciplinary nature of the field is discussed, with special reference to the ongoing reform of higher education in Europe known as the '' Bologna process.'' An illustrative case is provided by a survey of the field in the Scandinavian countries. The conclusion is that there is a need for radical reflection about the discipline in the contemporary world, calling for an approach to media studies in terms of the philosophy of science. The article presents notes for further thought rather than suggests final scenarios, and this is done from an admittedly personal and national perspective \textendash{} as a veteran of the field and as a member of the Finnish community.},

  abstract = {The article presents comments of the author on the February 1986, issue of "Journal of Advertising Research." According to the author, the journal is fortunate in having an oral historical record of interviews of pioneers who explored the unknown history of advertising research. According to the author, he had the privilege of meeting with and interviewing seven of the legendary practitioners of advertising research: Henry Brenner, Archibald Crossley, Ernest Dichter, George Gallup, Alfred Politz, Frank Stanton, and Hans Ziesel. The resulting interviews ranged from twenty minutes to forty minutes in length. His short-term purpose was to cut these down to a half-hour segment which would give a sense of the points of view and personalities of the seven pioneers. The true value of these interviews is that they represent oral history. According to the author, although his acquaintance with most of these pioneers of advertising research began with these interviews, he feels that he knows each of them very well because they gave so freely of themselves and their most profound thoughts about research in the course of these discussions.},

It examines if and how the three models are related and what potential relationships between them tell theorists and researchers about the effects of mass media. As an introduction to this effort, this essay provides a very brief review of the three effects and their roots in media-effects research. Based on this overview, we highlight a few key dimensions along which one can compare, framing, agenda setting, and priming. We conclude with a description of the contexts within which the three models operate, and the broader implications that these conceptual distinctions have for the growth of our discipline.},

Conceptual problems translate into operational problems, limiting the comparability of instruments and results. In this paper I systematize the fragmented approaches to framing in political communication and integrate them into a comprehensive model. I classify previous approaches to framing research along two dimensions: the type of frame examined (media frames vs. audience frames) and the way frames are operationalized (independent variable or dependent variable). I develop a process model of framing, identifying four key processes that should be addressed in future research: frame building, frame setting, individual-level processes of framing, and a feedback loop from audiences to journalists.},

It maps out the trajectory of Riesman's and Bell's early contributions to a critique of mass society in post-war America, as well as Bell's later formulation of '' liberalism in crisis'' and his assessment of culture in The Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism. This analysis pays particular attention to the intellectual, biographical, and social settings that helped to shape the often conflicting ideas of each thinker, and examines the discursive shifts within liberal thinking as it attempted to explain and deal with perceived new social crises from the 1950s to the present.},

This re-imagining can be seen in a number of approaches: platform and software studies, which examine the materiality of code and/or the technological infrastructure through which it is enacted; critical studies of digital labour; and detailed ethnographic studies that examine the cultures of online worlds and situate gaming in relation to everyday practices. The article traces these three strands, focusing on how they demonstrate a heightening of the stakes in game studies research by providing access to scale and connecting digital games research to wider interdisciplinary contexts.},

The study that they were doing in Saint Louis was one designed to find out what people read in their newspapers. He went back to the University of Iowa with the idea that there had to be a better way than what they were using. He made that his research thesis. Answering to a question on the future of advertising research Gallup said that, the future is tremendous. The next greatest contribution to medical advance is going to come through our kind of research into environmental factors. The relationship between smoking and lung cancer should have been discovered in the 1920's or early 1930's. Almost every illness is somehow related to the environment. It's related to the climate, the food habits of people, their living habits, all of these things.},

For several decades Publizistikwissenschaft had considered itself as one of the humanities. But at the beginning of the 1960s, a scientific debate started about the discipline's subjects, its methods and tasks. The forum for this debate was in the scholarly journal Publizistik. This article identifies the arguments and rhetorical repertoires employed by two scholars from opposite sides of the debate, Emil Dovifat and Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, to convince the scientific community to side respectively with either the social science or the humanities camp. It is shown that an array of arguments were utilized, from the political meanings and ethical aspects of media, to epistemological reasoning. Furthermore, it is surprising to see how dramatic and emotional the rhetorical repertoires were. The article also presents the biographical, historical and political context of the development of Germany's Publizistikwissenschaft.},

With his staples research programme exhausted, morally driven by issues of war and peace, and concerned by the social power of publishing, he followed newsprint into the marketplace of the big American newspaper. From there Innis investigated publishing technologies back to their origins in time. Conceptually and methodologically, Innis's inquiry into communications media was a parallel replication of the systematic historical method he employed to study staple economies. Harold Innis followed staples into communications where he came to recognize that, whether by the example of beaver pelts or by the example of advertising, he had always been studying the flow of media through empire and civilization.},

First, this work elaborates the challenge to the theory and practice of liberal democracy that Laswell presented through his application of a naturalistic political science. Secondly, it considers his response to the problematic character of democracy as both a practicable and desirable form of political rule. This study begins by outlining the anti-democratic implications of both the methodological standpoint and derived findings of an early naturalist behavioral science of politics. Having defined the general context of this investigation, this work then focuses on the logic and ramifications of Lasswell's approach to the study of political behavior. Through a consideration of his application of several different analytical frameworks and perspectives, this study shows that his research culminated in a set of findings which debunked many of the fundamental tenets underlying democratic liberalism. This work then discusses how Lasswell addressed the problematic character of democracy as a desirable and practicable form of political rule. First, it shows that underlying his commitment to a democratic social order was the conviction that such a polity was most suited to the development of a psychologically sound and healthy human society. Secondly, it considers the specific palliative that he prescribed for the ills of 'democratic statecraft.' This study concludes by highlighting the potentially anti-democratic and anti-liberal implications of Lasswell's call to constrain a politics of irrationalism by subjecting it to a set of rationalist principles derived through a form of democratic technology.},

  abstract = {In most discussions of Harold Innis' work on communications, his contributions have been treated as those of a general media theorist. His analyses of particular media are commonly viewed simply as instances of his broader account of how space- and time-binding media serve to bias societies and civilizations. This paper argues that Innis' generalizations about media derived, in fact, from his examination of how a particular cluster of media \textendash{} namely, printing and publishing, with particular reference to newspapers \textendash{} was linked to the onset of modernity. These concerns were evident in his magisterial unpublished manuscript, History of Communication. Drawing on its periodization and overarching themes, this paper examines Innis' account of the newspaper industry as it developed between the American Revolution and the mid-point of the twentieth century. The historical trajectory that Innis traces, it is argued, reveals the specific concerns about printing and modernity that underpinned his general reflections about time- and space-binding communications},

  abstract = {This study examines whether the status of crisis communication research is interdisciplinary by paying special attention to different perspectives from varying theories, methods, and authors. One hundred seventy-five articles published in major communication journals from 1991 to 2011 were extracted as crisis communication articles. The results of a quantitative content analysis revealed that, among theories applied to crisis research, most were from communication and public relations disciplines, which included framing, image restoration, situational crisis communication, and excellence theory. Although outside disciplines that have studied crisis communication research included psychology, economics, mathematics, and sociology, those disciplines made up less than one-third of the articles. Regarding the methodological approach, each portion of articles using two or more methods (e.g., experiment and survey) and a triangulation approach (e.g., qualitative and quantitative) was less than 10\%. However, the frequency of the triangulation, or mixed-method, approach has dramatically increased since 2006, which indicates that interdisciplinary crisis communication research is evolving into an interdisciplinary field. Another indication of this trend can be found in the variety of authors, institutions, and departments dedicated to crisis communication. Although crisis articles are published primarily by communication, journalism, and public relations departments, other diverse disciplines are also widely contributing to crisis communication research.},

  abstract = {'Cultural Studies' as an academic phenomenon has shown extraordinary growth expanding to universities throughout the English-speaking, settler colonies of Great Britain since first finding an institutional home in England at the University of Birmingham in 1963. Either departments bearing the new name were brought into being or specialties within existing departments declared themselves. This study situates the early success of cultural studies in the short-term conjuncture of the First (British) New Left which advanced 'culture' as an explanatory category in the midst of the upheavals of the mid-1950's as both mainstream and Marxist frameworks proved inadequate, and secondly, in the longer-term trend (since the controversy occasioned by the French Revolution) of conservative social criticism on the part of the literary intelligentsia. Part I is concerned with the determinate conditions of the emergence of the collection of political/intellectual issues which came to be known as cultural studies as a function of social time, that is the post-1945 Kondratieff expansion and the cycle of British hegemony and its passage to the United States. The development of work at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies\textendash{}its characteristic national mode and concern for theory, and the substantive areas of media studies, subcultures, ethnography, the working class, and race and gender\textendash{}is traced in Part II. The major efforts are allowed to 'speak for themselves', then the shape that cultural studies took in its migrations is examined. Part III is concerned with the trajectory of Cultural Studies through conjunctural space as the long-term structures of knowledge/power begin to break-up with the general onset of systemic fluctuations announcing the eminent demise and transformation of the Modern World-System. The post-1945 world (and the world of knowledge) ordered by the East-West competition of blocs/ideologies gives way to a world structured by the North-South clash of identities/subjectivities in which even science, guarantor of truth and summit of the disciplinary hierarchy, begins to question its own position from within.},

  abstract = {In an essay on French literature in the period of Nazi occupation, Herbert Marcuse argues that a literature of intimacy\textemdash{}love poems and romantic novels\textemdash{}is the last resort of freedom in totalitarian conditions. Written in 1945 and revised in the 1970s, Marcuse's essay argues that in the face of totalitarianism, a literature of intimacy opens a realm of human experience that is outside the control of the regime. Because it carries a memory of joy, it is radically other to the ethos of the regime. Later, in The Aesthetic Dimension (1978), Marcuse returns to the role of aesthetics when political change is unlikely to occur. The article revisits Marcuse's 1945 essay and his reading of the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Eluard. It begins by relating Marcuse's interest in love poetry to the work of other critical theorists who see a radical role for aesthetics and the pursuit of happiness in periods when political change is blocked. It examines the 1945 essay, puts it in context of Marcuse's work for the US intelligence services in the 1940s, and looks at the similarities between the 1945 essay and Marcuse's later writing. Finally, it asks whether Marcuse's arguments matter today (as the dreams for which the New Left of the 1960s went in search appear as remote as ever).},

Independent work was, however, carried out elsewhere. In Germany, Hermann Schmidt introduced the notion of Allgemeine Regelungskunde [general control theory] in the early 1940s, which bore many similarities to the almost exactly contemporary work of Wiener and colleagues. Schmidt's work was subsequently largely neglected during the rapid post-war dissemination of cybernetics ideas until it was, to a certain extent, rediscovered in Germany in the 1960s. There Schmidt is often credited, alongside Wiener, as one of the two 'fathers' of cybernetics.

  abstract = {This essay introduces a series of articles that explore the relation of history to political communication research. It is shown that as a field of study political communication has tended to ignore historical methods and sensibilities. This tendency is traced to the field's roots in social psychology, political science, and early mass communication research. However, although political communication tends to ignore historical research, it often depends upon implicit, unquestioned historical narratives. Thus, a more robust historical imagination is encouraged not only because it may produce more and better historical research, but also because it may assist in the development of tools for reflecting on the way political communication already deploys historical narratives.},

  abstract = {In 1946, after visiting Russia, Harold Innis remarked that the time had come to broaden the range of political economy by studying, first, the struggle for social supremacy between states, churches and commerce; and, second, the related competition between languages, religions, cultures and communications media. This, I argue, is what Innis accomplished. His early studies of Canadian economic history transcended conventional economics and laid the groundwork for a later political theory of communications. It expressly took up the 1946 challenge to address competing monopolies of knowledge and power, hence manipulating the space and time-binding properties of communications media. Innis' work reflected a materialist model of communications, a social ecology, a soft determinism or philosophic naturalism and it linked knowledge, freedom and power. Finally, I conclude, these insights permitted Innis to transcend bias and to search for a balanced culture. /// En 1946, apr{\`e}s avoir visit{\'e} la Russie, Harold Innis remarqua que le temps {\'e}tait venu d'{\'e}tendre l'{\'e}tude de l'{\'e}conomie politique {\`a} l'analyse de la lutte pour la supr{\'e}matie sociale entre les {\'e}tats, les {\'e}glises et le commerce, ainsi que la comp{\'e}tition qui y est reli{\'e}e entre les langues, les religions, les cultures et les m{\'e}dias de communication.

Then the authors describe and analyse the status of research at the beginning of the 21st century and present the opinion of researchers themselves concerning this situation. Subsequently, using the Delphi method, an analysis of the panorama of research in Spain is offered from the perspective of a group of Spanish researchers and lecturers in the field. Finally, the future prospects are discussed for communication theory and research in this European country. In general, this work aims to reflect on the state of communication theory as a social and humanistic science, in those democratic countries from the first world which incorporated the study of communication theory in their universities in the 1970s, based on an observation of the Spanish situation. Consequently, the issues analysed, the epistemological precept and the solutions proposed can be extrapolated to all those zones where the discipline is currently in a complete phase of consolidation, definition and maturity.},

  abstract = {This essay reconstructs communication theory as a dialogical-dialectical field according to two principles: the constitutive model of communication as a metamodel and theory as metadiscursive practice. The essay argues that all communication theories are mutually relevant when addressed to a practical lifeworld in which '' communication'' is already a richly meaningful term. Each tradition of communication theory derives from and appeals rhetorically to certain commonplace beliefs about communication while challenging other beliefs. The complementarities and tensions among traditions generate a theoretical metadiscourse that intersects with and potentially informs the ongoing practical metadiscourse in society. In a tentative scheme of the field, rhetorical, semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, socio-psychological, sociocultural, and critical traditions of communication theory are distinguished by characteristic ways of defining communication and problems of communication, metadiscursive vocabularies, and metadiscursive commonplaces that they appeal to and challenge. Topoi for argumentation across traditions are suggested and implications for theoretical work and disciplinary practice in the field are considered.},

There are different internal and external (societal and political) means which influenced the development of communication studies and theories in each of the two countries. The Sciences de l'information et de la communication (SIC) gained their academic acceptance in France in 1975 which under international comparison was late. One strong external moment of the instutionalization of SIC was the political aim to modernize the French University for the so called 'information society'. The French researchers developed their own focus. Semio-pragmatics and social constructivism are two basic theoretical orientations which, after the end of the limiting structuralistic paradigm of the 1960ths, lead to a fruitful connection of the analysis of the micro and the meso-level of communication processes. Thus, Pragmatics and Symbolic Interactionism played an important role in French SIC much earlier than in Germany.},

  abstract = {A framework encompassing the variables studied in 276 computer anxiety articles is created. A review of the findings of each of the 16 variables most often studied in conjunction with computer anxiety is presented. Differences in computer anxiety study results found between the 1990s and 2000s are noted. Future research directions are proposed. As computers became ubiquitous in businesses, homes, and schools, there was increasing concern about computer anxiety and its effect on individuals. The first academic articles on computer anxiety were published in the early 1980s. Since that time, hundreds of papers have been published on the topic. Yet, up to this time, no one has done a comprehensive review of computer anxiety. In this article, 276 articles on computer anxiety are reviewed. From a synthesis of the articles and variables studied to date, a framework is developed that outlines the primary topics studied in computer anxiety literature. Nine antecedents, five correlates, and two outcomes of computer anxiety are identified as the most studied variables in the literature. In addition, a statistical comparison is done to compare the distribution of computer anxiety topics and results published in the 1990s to those published in the 2000s. Suggestions for future research in computer anxiety are proposed.},

Since the appearance of its first book, Bad News (1976), the Glasgow University Media Group (GUMG) has made a sustained contribution to our understanding of media culture and especially to notions of objectivity and impartiality. Despite this, for the last 30 years the group has been the object of a diffuse and often gratuitous campaign of ridicule and misrepresentation. The authors of this misrepresentation first caricature the group, labelling it a band of Marxist conspiracy theorists, then blame the group for alienating journalists and retarding the cause of media research. This article presents evidence of this misrepresentation and then offers an apologia for the GUMG, in the now archaic sense that to apologize is to defend. It specifically seeks to explode some of the enduring myths that have gathered around the GUMG and its work. This article argues that the GUMG still offers us useful and relevant ways of approaching media culture \textendash{} ways which have, in fact, brought scholars and journalists closer together.},

It contrasts the political economy school with cultural studies. The positions of Herbert Schiller and Armand Mattelart on the `resistance debate' are outlined, with the author concluding that while Schiller still asserts the validity of cultural imperialism thinking, Mattelart has moved in a slightly different direction. Nonetheless, while the latter has welcomed the departure from monolithic research models, he by no means endorses cultural studies positions, particularly their political implications. The article also contrasts the way `resistance' has been used by postmodernists in the field of communications with its meaning as articulated by two prominent writers in the field of comparative literature: Edward Said and Ngugi Wa Thiong'o. Both writers still validate the notion of cultural imperialism and use the term `resistance' to refer to the struggles against colonialism and imperialism in the countries of the South.},

On the one hand there is a strong academ-ic interest in how cultural studies perceives and analyzes media culture, popular culture and everyday life. On the other hand boundaries with humanities and so-cial science remain, which leads to criticism and conflicts with cultural studies and its achievements. I will discuss some of the problems concerning the perception and reception of cultural studies among representatives of Kulturwissenschaft(en) and sociology of culture. Furthermore I will draw on the role of cultural studies in thematizing cul-tural change and conflicts, and its ability to do so in a way that shows the im-portance of culture and politics.},

  abstract = {This article reviews recent debates regarding the disciplinary status of cultural studies. In doing so, it takes issue with the tendency for cultural studies to fight shy of characterizing itself as a discipline. This involves an examination of the respects in which, especially in Australia, cultural studies has now acquired all the institutional trappings of a discipline. It is suggested that those perspectives which view the institutionalization of cultural studies as tantamount to its co-option rest on a misreading of its earlier history and of its relations to the education system. In terms of its intellectual characteristics, it is suggested that cultural studies is distinguished by a number of traits regarding its approaches to the analysis of the role of culture in relations of power and subjectivity. It is these qualities, it is argued, that have allowed cultural studies to play a more general role as an interdisciplinary 'clearing-house' within the humanities. The article concludes by considering the qualities that have most distinguished Australian cultural studies, placing the stress on its strong feminist orientations, its contributions to our understanding of the relations between culture and nation, and its role in connecting cultural studies to the concerns of cultural policy.},

  abstract = {In this article, we describe the eccentric location of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy: while it remains marginal in terms of institutional recognition, it is nevertheless important in terms of the interest it arouses in professors and students alike, and in the amount and quality of publications in the area. The field's general flexibility appeals both to many established researchers, who employ its methodologies to expand the scope of their investigations, and to many students, who become frustrated with disciplinary rigidity and with the difficulty in carrying out academic projects with overtly political underpinnings from the traditional disciplines of the humanities and social sciences. While student demand is clearly strong in much of Latin America, the response to the rise of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy has taken two general forms: (1) an opening up of spaces within existing disciplines (anthropology, communications, literature, etc.) for the more interdisciplinary or politicized work and (2) the foundation of new programmes in Cultural Studies. We use as examples the case studies of Argentina and Colombia, countries that have a completely different academic history and tradition. We survey the diverse ways in which Cultural Studies has entered institutional spaces in both countries. Colombia offers the case of an academy that appears to have welcomed the institutionalization of Cultural Studies, at least superficially, while Argentina appears to have resisted ceding the field institutional space. Nonetheless, its presence in both countries is strongly palpable; it is clearly a force too strong to be suppressed by resistance from the traditional disciplines.},

Shunya Yoshimi is one of the leading figures in cultural studies in Japan since its introduction in the mid-1990s. He is currently engaged in the task of developing cultural studies in Asia with younger generations of scholars and to this end has helped established a new type of cultural movement, Cultural Typhoon, as well as contributing to expand Asian cultural studies networks, such as Inter Asia Cultural Studies. He argues that cultural studies has been questioning the relationship between meaning and power in everyday life through a variety of concrete and practical fields. In fact, he argues, it is inevitable for cultural studies to ask questions about the politics, if we in cultural studies are to develop actual knowledge of cultural production and consumption today. Hence, it is essential to investigate the micro-politics of bodies in relation to macro-political processes. In the case of Japan, working on cultural studies within an existing discipline also means engaging in experiments, which ultimately could have the potential to undermine existing disciplines from within.},

Based on the so-called double periphery \textendash{} the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology \textendash{} the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina's last dictatorship (1976\textendash{}1983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, it is essential to re-examine the field's sociological aspects as it moves along this path.},

In 1929 the Council appointed a committee, including Paul Cherington as chairman, himself and two or three others, to plan to establish a national marketing organization. The only national association then existing was the Association of Teachers of Marketing and Advertising, established around 1914 or 1915. The basic, original purpose in organizing the Market Research Council, fifty years ago, was to bring together in closer association the men who held and followed the high ideals of scientific research and work. It was true of the members at that time. Percival White, a member of MRC, was a typical example. It was true then and it has been true down the years.},

A decade later, many researchers have answered the call, with several defining studies examining the social and psychological influences on risk communication. This article reviews risk communication research appearing in the published literature since 1996. Among studies, social trust, the social amplification of risk framework, and the affect heuristic figured prominently. Also common were studies examining the influence of risk in the mass media. Among these were content analyses of media coverage of risk, as well as investigations of possible effects resulting from coverage. The use of mental models was a dominant method for developing risk message content. Other studies examined the use of risk comparisons, narratives, and visuals in the production of risk messages. Research also examined how providing information about a risk's severity, social norms, and efficacy influenced communication behaviors and intentions to follow risk reduction measures. Methods for conducting public outreach in health risk communication rounded out the literature.},

  abstract = {In this article, I discuss contemporary disputes within communication theory over the Dewey-Lippmann 'debate' as symptomatic of a broader inability to treat classical pragmatism as an intellectual tradition. If we return historicity to the relationship of classical pragmatism and communication, and if we develop a fuller understanding of the distinctive aspects of pragmatist theories of inquiry, we can better understand the contributions of John Dewey and Walter Lippmann to a novel conception of democracy as problem-solving. In this way, we recover what is distinctive about pragmatist approaches to democracy and acquire a more differentiated sense of politics that refuses to reduce classical pragmatist writing to deliberative or dialogic conceptions of democracy.

These are: (a) the problematic of voice, (b) the problematic of rationality, (c) the problematic of organization, and (d) the problematic of the organization-society relationship. Together, these problematics articulate a conception of organizational communication that defines it as both object of study and discipline in a way that is radically different from other fields that study organizational phenomena.},

Compared with digital PR research before 2008, we find that 1) social media have become a major research topic while remaining a secondary concern of many PR practitioners; 2) digital PR studies are gradually shifting from description to theorization; 3) the examined studies witnessed a general trend of methodological diversification but this trend needs to continue in order for scholars to better describe, predict, and explain how digital PR should be organized and practiced; and 4) digital PR research frameworks are dominated by the organizational perspective, whereas increasing attention has been paid to organizations in the nonprofit sector. Compared to digital PR research before 2008, our findings suggest that the development of digital technology in recent years has brought about changes in PR research such that the research paradigm is presently shifting and acts as a competing paradigm but has not yet shifted completely.},

  abstract = {This paper is an investigation into the philosophy and the history of the social sciences. Some philosophers of the social sciences have suggested that a key feature of the natural sciences is their capacity to create phenomena, and that the social sciences do not meet this criterion. We suggest, to the contrary, that the social sciences can and do create phenomena, in the sense of new ways of describing and acting that have been used to produce all sorts of effects. Like the natural sciences, the social sciences create their phenomena through the procedures that are established to discover them. But the creation of phenomena is a complex, technically difficult and contested process and its success rare. Historically, this argument is developed through a case-study of the development and evolution of public opinion research in the USA and Britain. We argue that by the 1950s public opinion produced a version of the world that had entered 'into the true'. Special attention is given to technical considerations in the development of public opinion research, especially the genealogy of a particular research technology, that of the representative sample. Whilst we are not concerned with demarcation criteria, we argue that there are some important differences between the social and the natural sciences; that the former have a less concentrated 'spatial mix' and a slower 'tempo of creativity'. None the less, in this particular case, the social sciences have played a key role in the creation of opinioned persons and an opinionated society.},

Ray Heisey (1932\textendash{}2011) was exceptionally well regarded both by professional colleagues and former students as an early promoter of the academic field of intercultural communication, with a lifelong commitment to the inherent value of dialogic communication at all levels of teaching and research. He was remembered as '' a dedicated scholar,'' '' a generous soul,'' as a '' mentor, and model,'' '' extremely kind to international students,'' '' a great educator'' who '' practiced what he preached in his life,'' and as Wenshan Jia eugulized him: '' Ray's professional life as an intercultural scholar, intercultural education, and intercultural practitioner was a unique success because he had integrated these three principles in his daily professional life'' (Jia, 2011, May). One of Heisey's major contributions was his advocacy of the dialogic approach to the teaching, study, and research in intercultural communication, a constant over his professional life and highlighted both in his leadership of Damavand College in Tehran and his exchange programs, teaching, and research related to China. On campus when the March 4, 1970 shootings occurred at Kent State University, he reflected well on this event. This important contribution led to his high level of interest in peace and conflict management and resolution, as seen both in his research on such conflict in the Middle East and the Soviet Union. Deeply spiritual, much of his research related to religion in communication, women's rights, and peace issues. Visiting China eleven times, and teaching there for two semesters, his series editorship of '' Advances in Communication and Culture,'' following his co-editorship with Wenxiang Gong, saw the publication of five more books relating to Chinese communication, all of which enhanced the intercultural understanding of China. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Professor D.

  abstract = {Journalism education's historical origins, intellectual tradition and media constituency have directed the field away from what could be a more lively engagement with the liberal arts, which are accepted in principle at least by academy and industry as a valuable foundation for professional journalism education. Yet students are increasingly disengaged from the democratic process, signaling a crucial need for promoting greater civic engagement. We urge a broader educational commitment to the professionalism of scholarship, as opposed to the more conventional view of media professionalism in the academy increasingly promoted by the media industry. Meanwhile, the academic communication field\textendash{}the prevailing disciplinary identity of journalism\textendash{}has emphasized media effects and audience studies. As universities seek greater external financial support, this research is easily directed toward applied, or administrative, research, leaving broader questions of journalism and democracy up for grabs. Our view of academic professionalism is based on a broader social responsibility, and we are concerned that the educational mission should not be dictated by external agendas. While journalism in some ways occupies an academic no man's land, accepted by neither industry nor more traditional liberal arts disciplines, it can be viewed alternatively as a potentially fruitful academic intersection, providing leadership in educational reform.},

A faculty member in Communication Studies at the University of Kansas for more than forty years, she was a pioneer and builder in intercultural communication, helping to conceptualize its theory and pedagogy. Her scholarship and leadership are notable in the areas of language, ethics, conflict, and gender studies. Born in Manila, she adopted the world as her sphere for intercultural scholarship and practice with a global perspective, and her endless pursuit of intercultural opportunities took her around the world, literally, as a scholar, visiting professor and conferee. She published more than fifty articles on a variety of topics, and presented at more than seventy conferences. She was a pioneer in the International and Intercultural Division of NCA, SIETAR International, ICA, the Pacific and Asian Communication Association where she served as president, and the Central States Communication Association. Her editorial role in professional journals included Human Communication and the Howard Journal of Communications. She was also a mentor, guide, role model, and consummate encourager for her students at the University of Kansas. Whether consciously or unconsciously, Asunci{\'o}n-Lande consistently operationalized an etic and emic approach to intercultural communication scholarship.},

  abstract = {The work of Erving Goffman has been influential in media studies, primarily via adaptations of selected concepts like ?region? and ?frame.? However, relatively little attention has been paid by media researchers to Goffman's own theoretical work on the mass media. Taking its lead from the later work of Goffman, this essay shows how it contains elements of a theoretical framework for mass-mediated communication, through the concepts of ?hyper-ritualization? and ?dramatic scriptings.? I emphasize the way that Goffman situates mass communication in relation to the interpersonal realm as a model version of the latter, as mass communication is crafted, concentrated, and planned to a degree that interpersonal communication is not. I conclude that Goffman's critical approach to informality in broadcast talk and interaction is a valuable tool for the researcher in a time when the rhetoric of informality has become a dominant mode of legitimation in broadcasting.},

The article argues that Rogers' life journey represents the quintessential intercultural life: a poor, Iowa farm boy who became an internationally recognized global intellectual; a scholar, who theorized about both macro- and micro-aspects of social change and provided a heuristic framework with remarkable potential for field-based application; a sense-maker who remained solidly anchored in the field of diffusion of innovations, but who continually deepened and extended his curiosity to other areas such as communication networks, entertainment\textendash{}education, and international, intercultural, health, and organizational communication; a prodigious mentor who affirmed, validated, and challenged his students to pursue unasked or intriguing questions; a genuine networker who understood the social capital advantages of learning from heterophilous others, affirming and embodying the value of diversity; a global citizen who traveled widely, learned other languages, lived for extended durations in faraway lands, and who maintained a sense of humanity and humility in his interactions with others. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Rogers' life journey was quintessentially intercultural: a poor, Iowa farm boy to internationally recognized global intellectual. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A scholar-practitioner, who theorized and engaged with both macro- and micro-aspects of social change. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A networker, who understood the social capital advantages of learning from heterophilous others. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A global citizen, who traveled, learned languages, and cultivated humanity and humility in his diverse interactions.},

The results reveal a weak academic culture that contrasts with a strong professional culture among the members of this community, but also the influence that both organizational and individual variables have on Chilean JMC educators' orientations. Specifically, the analyses indicated that the level of education, part-time/full-time commitment, and the type of university are the most influential factors in defining both the prevalence of a professional culture and the lack of research productivity. These findings support other international studies, indicating a global tendency across key variables that influence academic development in the field. Likewise, it shows how distant Chilean JCM educators are from the university-scholarly tradition.},

Here I argue for a politics of the emergent, an increasing turn towards the negotiation of the possible, the drawing in of trans-national frames, and the reformulation of theories of race in the aftermath of resistance politics. Studies of popular culture during this period increasingly come to be superseded by a focus on public culture and on circulation.

On asking about the problems and issues that researchers had to face in earlier days Crossley said that the problems were considerable because there was almost no marketing information at the time. There were very few books on marketing, and just a few books on advertising. The census data was very limited information in the census and it was out of date at that particular time. There was almost nothing at that time on the number of readers of a magazine or even the number of people that got a magazine. What happened then was that the publishers would issue what they call "publishers' statements of circulation." The trouble was that sometimes those statements consisted only of the number of copies printed. Answering to a question related to the problems and issues that the research community is facing today, he said that one of the greatest problems is the completion rate in surveying, particularly with the probability sampling method in which call-backs are required. The completion rate has gone down. It's becoming much more difficult to get interviews.},

Drawing on his letters to the Corinthians and other early groups of Christ-followers, I argue that Paul used eloquent mediated rhetoric to conceptualize local ritual practice in such a way that it could form the basis for widespread solidarity and mass community in a geographically expanding religious sect. This was a form of mass communication centered in dispersed bodily assemblies and radiating outward to encompass ever wider regions of a distended mass society. It hinged on the Body of Christ, which in Paul's letters became a space- and time-binding medium of mass communication that held together a dispersed society of the Christ-proclaiming faithful. Paul was essentially an early medium theorist, and I argue that his bifocal attention to local assembly and distant solidarity is instructive for both the study and social practices of mass communication today.},

As a communicative phenomenon and research object, social media would appear to be in flux. Changes to existing services, the emergence of new services, and the disappearance of previously popular services testify to the sense of social media as a moving target. Researchers of social media seem to accept change, rather than continuity, as a condition for the study of social media. This is evident in our choice of research topics and data sources, but also in our discourses on social media. By examining the sense of flux of social media research in a historical perspective, this article aims to provide useful directions for future media and communication research on social media. Specifically, it suggests ways to stabilise social media as an object of study and to install a greater historical awareness in social media research.},

  abstract = {Main characteristics, challenges, current practices and future directions of mass communication research are examined from a sociology of science perspective to determine the influence of theory, method and utility to government and industry decision makers on the development of future directions of research activity in this field. Intellectual underpinnings for theory, method and utility for mass communication research activity are traced through the more established social sciences which from the 1930s through the 1960s were based on fairly stable pragmatist and behavioral assumptions. However, by the 1970s when anticipated theories and procedures of this orientation had not gone unchallenged alternate philosophies and research approaches with new perspectives on the purposes of social science research began to receive greater attention from North American scholars. Mass communication, distinctly American social science which developed during the era of stability, had by the 1970s also experienced the repercussions of challenge and disaffection with a positivist, behavioral research orientation. The degree to which challenges have affected mainstream research activity by the 1980s is examined from the perspective of the influence of funding, sponsorship arrangements and university setting. Nine hypotheses concerning the impact of institutional structures on research activity and researcher perspectives on the field are tested through survey techniques. Nominal data was gathered relative to the recent past, present, and planned future research activity of mass communication researchers affiliated with major and minor American universities. Statistical analysis using Chi-Square provided partial confirmation for the research hypotheses which posit a disassociation between the primary research activity of scholars and what they perceive as the most relevant approaches and areas for research innovation in the field. Developed as a service oriented field, mass communication research appears to continue following the original directions for research activity. However, researchers also seem to be aware and concerned about the limitations of the research agenda and supportive of developing theories, procedures and structures for more actively pursuing alternate approaches to research activity.},

  abstract = {This essay asserts that it is impossible to understand any communicative utterance outside the context in which it is uttered. Within this context, I expound a conception of communication based on ideas in information theory and on Niklas Luhmann's systems theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the context dependency of utterances. At the same time, I introduce readers to Luhmann's version of systems theory, which is becoming more and more influential in German literary theory. The view of communication expounded here implies that as all meaning is founded on difference, an utterance can acquire meaning only by differing from other utterances, that is, by negating other positions. Therefore, the context is always part of the utterance; it enters, so to speak, into the utterance. At issue here is a specific type of context, a specific axis of difference, correlated with the utterance in a particular way. I try to show exactly how this specific conceptualization of the relation between meaning and context, between communication and difference, is to be understood. First, I discuss the systems theoretical concept of communication and illustrate it with several examples taken largely from political and literary communication. Next, I address the way this concept of communication and difference diverges from (post)structuralist theories, to which it might seem to bear some resemblance. Finally, I examine the difficult question of the relationship between communicative utterances, contexts, and their place within social systems, focusing especially on Luhmann's conceptualization of the art system.},

@article{freedman_technological_2002,
  abstract = {Raymond Williams was a prolific cultural commentator and historian and his writing on communications technology provides a particularly relevant framework for understanding contemporary information-society innovations. Williams sought to distinguish questions of technique and technical invention from their realization in the fundamentally social organization of technologies themselves and emphasized the importance of agency and intention in structuring the uses to which technologies are put. Far from technology having an inescapable internal logic of development, innovation takes place within specific social and economic contexts. For Williams, this meant that there was no pre-determined outcome to the evolution of communications innovations but a series of complex interactions between innovations and the world into which they emerge. This article will provide an assessment of Williams' work on technological innovation, his critique of determinism and his commitment to democratic communications. Williams helps us to challenge the simplistic proposition that 'the Internet has changed our world' and enables us to understand instead the ways in which contemporary social relations set limits on the development of the Internet as a democratic medium.},

It is further proposed that by developing a multi-level conception of audiences that analytically links the macro and the micro, several existing problems facing reception studies - particularly concerning the nature of audience activity and resistance - may be addressed.},

  abstract = {After a survey of the major critical trends since the generalization of synchronized film sound, this bibliographical essay sets out to delineate the way film sound studies have developed around issues of taxonomy, meaning, and reception. Focusing on the treatment of the disembodied voice by various theorists, three trends can be identified: borrowing from semiology and narratology, an essentially descriptive approach first emerges that creates a new vocabulary to talk about sound and analyze the links between sound and image. A second approach emphasizes the possible meanings of the disembodied voice, a trend heavily influenced by Lacanian theories and their later adaptations by feminist film theorists. Finally, some researchers have opted for semio-pragmatic or cognitive approaches that take into account the experience of audiences. These different approaches underline the way film sound has evolved as an object of study, to be considered as a complex and flexible phenomenon. They also have developed tools that can be applied to other audiovisual media in which the role of sound and the voice should not be underestimated.},

  abstract = {Fan studies as a discipline is still in its infancy. But even given this nascence, there have been significant shifts in the ways that it has theorized, studied and investigated fans over the first two and a half decades of research. As scholarship, fan studies has moved away from ethnographic investigations of fans as the main object of study to focus instead on the output of fan discourse as the key mode of examination. At the same time, scholars like Henry Jenkins and Matt Hills, both central to the discipline, have opened dialogue about the nature of the fan/academic, often called the `aca-fan'. This article uses the lens of aca-fandom to analyse fan answers to interview questions at a large Midwestern Doctor Who convention. Fans were asked about the role that fan studies has played in their life, how they perceive the study of fans and whether fan studies as an academic discipline has an effect on their fandom. The fans' answers reflect a critical awareness of fandom but a general ignorance of fan studies. This article argues three points to take away from this. First, fan studies needs to refocus attention back onto fans themselves through ethnographic work. Second, the discipline needs to refocus its output less on esoteric academic titles and more on popular venues. Finally, fans and academics should engage in specific dialogue to open up avenues for new fannish and academic exploration.},

The article intends to review the context and nature of critical media and communication studies, seen through the author's personal experience in national as well as international spheres. While the testimony is autobiographical, an attempt is made to contemplate career development from the outside unlike in conventional memoires. This article is a prelude to a reflective review of the author's professional and political life story, forthcoming as a book in Finnish. The introduction gives examples of the use of the term '' critical'' in the field of media and communication studies, followed by a review of different ways in which the critical concept is used in the literature of the field, leading to a reflection on the precarious relationship between the intellectual and the political. A personal testimony by the author then provides a case illustrating how a scholar becomes critical under the influence of philosophical, political and international factors. The discussion at the end offers some concluding reflections.},

In recognizing the feminist influence in the development of cultural studies, it is also important to acknowledge that this implicates feminism in an approach that often overcompensates for traditional Marxism's determinism and neglect of cultural experience by ignoring the structural constraints imposed by political and economic realities. This article traces the developments between feminism and Marxism and cultural studies and political economy, suggesting that the answer to the problem of separate spheres is not to populate one sphere at the expense of the other. Rather, what is needed is a feminist political economy that reconciles the insights of '' the politics of representing the Other'' with a much-needed material dimension that only a political economy approach can provide.},

They claim that the study of 'speech' has always had a biological element in it.

While indicating that the four views are different, they encourage trying to pull the research together. They also encourage all communication researchers to begin investigating the biological approach.},

The first approach is represented by social scientists, who, with some exceptions, seek to understand the effects of games on users. The second approach is favored by humanists, who seek to understand the meaning and context of games. To date, these two groups have largely talked past one another due to their different goals and their different methodologies. Yet, for the advancement of science and understanding, both sets of scholarship are important and relevant. Each has contributions to make. However, unless these two groups come to possess at least a cursory understanding of the other's methodology, there will be little synthesis. This is a missed opportunity for scholars of every stripe, and ways are suggested to bridge these gaps.!},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to examine the way American businesses and marketers used research to shape the concept of the consumer at the turn of the twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} A historical, cultural approach is used to examine published and unpublished writings of economists, marketers, researchers, and publishers from the 1880s to about 1930. The primary focus is Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies' Home Journal, and creator of one of the first market research departments in the USA. Findings \textendash{} The argument is made that publishers and advertisers took the values of a republic, values which has long empowered and idealized white property owners, and redefined those values in terms of buying ability. In doing so, they embed many biases in their market research, yet gave businesses a working concept of the consumer and helped shape society's ideals of the consumer. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} As with all historical research, it is limited by the primary sources that have survived and are available. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper shows how early market research can provide an important perspective into the making of a consumer society, and how it can be used by historians and current practitioners to understand the methods, biases, and assumptions that have guided marketers and market research.},

It makes that case by reconstructing persistent political economic dimensions in the work of Charles Horton Cooley, who more than anyone else de-serves to be called the intellectual founder of communication study in the U.S. Drawing out previously neglected aspects of Cooley's thought, it sketches how his pragmatist, social democratic brand of political economics took a holis-tic, historically informed view of the communicative constitution and social or-ganization of selves, institutions, and political cultures. Cooley provides a starting point for a revised understanding of the history of political economic thinking about communication and ways that it has intersected with sociology, cultural study, and democratic theory},

@phdthesis{arcenas_communication_1995,
  abstract = {The disciplinary status of communication study (academic communication) has remained a point of contention among scholars, largely for paucity of systematic information on the field's historical institutionalization. The process of gaining academic legitimacy through the granting of doctorates has been complex and often confusing. It involved a variety of labels, departmental sponsorships and resistances, and personal ambitions. This study sought to trace these paths from their identifiable beginnings through the 1980s and thus to contribute to the discussion about and further development of the field. Using a multi-method approach (quantitative content analysis, case histories, career trajectory analysis), this study tracked\textendash{}through the word communication\textendash{}the field's natural history from its early linguistic manifestations through its crystallizations in structures and roles. It is composed in three parts. Part I, an analysis of the word communication in the Journalism Quarterly, 1924-1949, presents communication study as emerging from the search by journalism for academic legitimacy. This search went through stages, representing shifts in conceptualizing communication and codified in key phrases\textendash{}news communication, mass communication, communication research. The "communication research" phase of thinking, in the 1940s, provided the immediate context for the major institutional changes that would accommodate communication study. Part II gives an account of the establishment of the communication Ph.D. and structures for study and research (research centers, institute, department, college) in five pioneering universities (Universities of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan State). Part III, based on interviews with thirty-two selected communication scholars, describes the emergence of a new professional group and discerns patterns in the career trajectories of its members, some of whom became communication scholars by academic employment (the "Settlers" group), others by doctoral training ("New Stock"). The convergence of the popularity of the communication label, of the necessary institutional changes to accommodate the research-oriented label and the people who made it possible, create historic opportunities for major developments in the field. These changes establish the pattern of institutionalization and the progress toward legitimate claim to offer a Ph.D.},

Consequently, Hortense Powdermaker, Mae Huettig, and Helen MacGill Hughes do not seem seminal to the development of communication scholarship during its nascent era of the 1930s\textendash{}1960s, despite these women working and publishing within the same academic circles as Harold Lasswell, Dallas Smythe, and Paul Lazarsfeld. Social, economic, and political factors diminished their contributions to what we now call media effects theory, political economy of communication, and media studies.

  abstract = {This article aims to retrieve the problem-responsive dimension of pragmatist theories in their relevance for the reconceptualization of public participation in communication theory. This dimension is central to pragmatist perspectives on the formation and functioning of publics and I propose that we reconstruct pragmatism as a tradition of communication theory in light of this fact. First, I reexamine the historical emergence of pragmatism in communication theory and I suggest James Carey was unable to challenge positivism or objectivism from within a pragmatist tradition. Second, I retrieve John Dewey's account of inquiry in a manner anticipating its implications for his theory of publics. Third, I resituate the Dewey\textendash{}Lippmann debate within the context of a pragmatist tradition to demonstrate how deeply their differences turn on problem formulation. In conclusion, I connect the pragmatist tradition to contemporary work on problematization to address the limitations of each perspective.},

The findings of the meta-review of 20 years of Chinese Internet research, as gleaned from quantitative and qualitative analysis of the collected body of publications, are presented and discussed in this report. It engages with the conclusions drawn by previous meta-studies, and seeks to shed a critical, self-reflexive light onto the main discursive formations of their research field. The article concludes that there is still a lot of scope for growth in studies of the Internet in China and lists several of the identified research gaps.},

The past 20 years have seen major changes in telecommunications technology and applications. They have also seen the deregulation of the telecommunications market and the pervasive penetration of the working environment by networked systems. Articles published in Behaviour \& Information Technology have reflected these changes. Some research topics have attracted continuing interest throughout this period, and two are reviewed briefly: the effect of network delays on users and the relative effectiveness of different media and user choices between them. In addition, many new technical and theoretical developments have been reported. Two major theoretical trends have been the convergence between behavioral research in telecommunications and computing and the rise in social science-based research. The question of whether published behavioral research has been able to influence the development of the technologies studied is considered. Finally, the article speculates on future topics for research.},

My title is derived from Bertolt Brecht's '' Anecdotes of Mr Keuner'' in which he extols the virtue of thinking up questions to which we do not have answers (Brecht, 1966). Working from this principle, rather than trying to formulate solutions to the problems of our field, my contribution here is based on questions in media audience research to which I, at least, do not have the answers, as a way of taking stock of what exactly it is that we think we now know about the field.},

A voluminous corpus of social-scientific research conducted over more than fifty years has established that audience members are drawn to media in order to achieve particular gratifications, that gratification-seeking influences not only selection of media content but also the way persons affectively and cognitively relate to the content, and shapes the consequences of exposure as well. Recent work has endeavored to reveal the social and psychological influences that give rise to gratification-seeking and to locate gratification-seeking in its natural context of media attitudes and behaviors that collectively shape the effects of media exposure. In the future, uses and gratifications research is likely to continue to expand its horizons and to contribute to related approaches to media and audiences, but fundamental political, theoretical, and methodological differences will prevent an alliance with the new ethnographic approaches to critical and cultural audience studies.},

  abstract = {This article examines the theories of the press that circulated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, relating them to their economic, political and intellectual contexts. It argues that elite discussions of the press often stood in for discussions of the changing relationship between the elite and popular classes. In the mid-19th century, and ideal of the press as an `educational' agency predominated; the press should involve readers in a public discussion that contributed to self-government. As the electorate and reading public expanded, this ideal began to decline and give way to an ideal of the press as `representing' the people. In this formulation, the ordinary reader was not credited with rational thinking, and instead of involving readers in a public discussion, this theory proposed that newspapers should speak for the readers.},

  abstract = {This essay provides an introduction to the ways in which Amusing Ourselves to Death by Neil Postman has been applied to Chinese cultural studies, and especially to media studies. It argues that the emerging phenomenon of '' amusing ourselves to death'' in China is fundamentally different from the phenomenon of '' amusing ourselves to death'' in the United States and that this difference has been masked by the decontextualized mechanical application of Western cultural theories, an increasingly common practice in Chinese cultural studies. In fact, Chinese-style '' amusing ourselves to death'' is a combination of George Orwell's Big Brother and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as well as a product of Chinese post-totalitarianism or, in other words, of advanced totalitarianism. As such, it resembles neither a totalitarian culture of the Stalinist model nor an American-style '' amusing ourselves to death,'' but rather a new culture that combines totalitarianism and consumerism and that calls for theoretical innovations and reconstructions in cultural studies.},

In fact, said Bliven, radio did not even figure to improve education or expose the public to new ideas. One reason was the control of broadcasting by commercial interests that were determined to make it "an organ of orthodoxy." But a more fundamental reason lay in the nature of the new medium. Inflated expectations of radio's power had arisen from the assumption that radio listeners would exhibit the restlessness and suggestibility that mark the psychology of people in crowds. Bliven pointed out, however, that the radio audience differed fundamentally from a crowd; it consisted of listeners distinguished more by their passive aloneness than by their excitable togetherness. Thus broadcasting had little capacity to serve the ends of demagogic politicians. Radio could touch the millions, Bliven suggested, but it could budge them in only trivial ways.},

  abstract = {Although Walter Benjamin's '' The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction'' is a seminal essay in the study of media history, the work itself gives a surprisingly brief account of one of field's core subjects: the printing press. Books and literature present only a special case of mechanical reproduction, according to Benjamin, but the implications of this point remain largely unexplored by scholars. The purpose of this essay is to ask why Benjamin would have considered print to be different or less historically consequential compared to photography and cinema when the revolutionary potential he ascribes to these more recent technologies is also prefigured in his other writings on books and literature. Answering this question helps to create a sharper picture of what matters to Benjamin about new media and also points to figures like Georg Luk{\'a}cs who influenced Benjamin's account of technology and art. Ultimately, this line of questioning also raises concerns about the place of the '' Work of Art'' essay in the study of media history, a field in which the signal error is to treat new media as unprecedented developments.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the unique educational relevancy of Walter Benjamin's radio broadcasts. While much has been written about Benjamin's approach to both children's literature and children's theatre, his own pedagogical practice as a radio pedagogue remains largely marginalized in these discussions. In order to address this gap in the literature, I focus on the implications of shifting from the largely visual world of children (celebrated in color illustrations) to the auditory world of radio. Through a careful reading of the radio scripts, I argue that a perceptual alteration unique to the sonic medium of radio jumpstarts historical thinking in children. The following pedagogical principles which I extract from the radio broadcasts support and enhance this mode of historical materialist education. In conclusion, the article argues for the ongoing relevancy of Benjamin for thinking through the pedagogical implications of new information technologies within a postmodern era such as podcasts.},

Academic discussions on CCI have grown extensively after the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) identified 13 sectors as constituting creative industries in the UK in 1998. The public has also become gradually convinced of the significance of CCI as being important for economic growth. We adopt a systematic and quantitative method to review the academic CCI literature. After collecting data, we first investigate the research fields under which the journals that publish CCI papers are categorized, finding that Business, Economics and Geography are the top three research fields. A second examination on the authors' nationality indicates that their cultural background induces a different emphasis on their research field. We lastly apply the multiple main paths analysis to uncover the development trajectories of CCI research, with the result showing that the research agenda has changed along with a better understanding of the essential elements of CCI. Based on the literature on the main path, we observe the top five discussed themes: information technology, global cooperation, micro and fragmentary creative activities, remote places, and country/regional characteristics. Monitoring the discussions on these themes may help CCI researchers, creative workers, and policy makers to assess future directions for economic development.},

Topic modeling reveals a high diversity from the early years on.

The first part of the interview focused on the creation of Communication Theory. Next, Craig used the conversation metaphor to capture the character of communication theorizing. He then discussed recent responses to his theoretical work and elaborated his rationale for moving toward empirical work at the intersection between communication theory and practical metadiscourse. Finally, he reflected on the challenges of teaching communication theory to undergraduate and graduate students.},

Lazarsfeld, Merton, and their colleagues conducted many detailed studies that contributed to a paradigmatic revolution. Yet the revolution went unrecognized at the time. Why? Many Columbia sociologists saw themselves as closer to Marx, and only years after their core ideas emerged, was the term '' post-industrial'' applied by Bell. They still contributed a middlerange set of propositions and findings that cumulatively transformed the broader paradigms. Their work offers useful concepts and propositions to interpret the post-industrial society of the early twenty-first century. These concepts are presented in tables contrasting them with Marxist and individualist concepts. Key examples are explored.},

Ritual communication is no longer seen as a static concept counterposed for all time to a '' transmission'' view of communication, but rather as an independent, dynamic and increasingly deromanticized perspective on our contemporary media experience. The former emphasis on its idealized religious and ceremonial origins has given way to an acknowledgment of its complicated and ambiguous social role. While ritual has traditionally been perceived as uniting communities by reflecting and establishing shared meanings, Elihu Katz, Daniel Dayan, Eric Rothenbuhler and James Carey have enriched the concept with notions of power, authority and control.},

Three interrelated questions will be addressed: first, Lowenthal's preparation for his work at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt; then the Institute's transfer to Columbia and Lowenthal's role in developing a sociology of literature and popular culture; and finally, the implications of Lowenthal's mentorship of Katz at the beginning of his scholarly career.},

Thus with next to no critical inquiry from media researchers, the Ford Foundation \textendash{} which is arguably one of the most influencial liberal foundations \textendash{} supplied over \$292 million to American public broadcasting between 1951 and 1977 and continues to fund progressive media groups like FreePress and Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting.

It could even be applied more generally to include print media. The then novel usage of the term was a component in the larger paradigm of mass communications that in turn rested on certain preconceptions about its ?mass? character. These preconceptions have been challenged by subsequent research and theory. More recently, however, the ongoing transformation of the means of communication may have rendered the whole mass communication paradigm itself obsolescent, and with it the concept of a mass audience. In this article it is argued that paradigmatic change in ideas about the audience may be less due to a shift in technology than to the more fundamental theoretical changes of the intervening period.},

The one addressed in this article is the natural history approach, which has had substantial influence over many social interaction scholars. Bateson brought his assumptions about how to study the natural world into his studies of the social world, and his assumptions still guide much research today. This chapter describes the natural history approach and its connection to Bateson; shows the way in which this approach has moved through the communication literature; and discusses the ways in which this approach has in.uenced scholars writing today.},

Greater understanding of the relationships between the new managerial rhetoric and the old criticism will facilitate a rapprochement that has been underway since the 1940s, and will both ease a persistent source of critical ferment and help resolve discrepant critical perspectives on modern social influence.},

To assess the research trends and methodological patterns of TPE studies on Asia and the world's other regions, this study content-analyzed 147 articles published in 10 leading communication journals between 1983 and 2015. Results reveal Asia as a popular site for the robust TPE research (41 articles focused on Asia). The most popular topics in Asia were pornography and news about social events. The results further indicate that survey was the most used method in TPE research conducted in Asia. In addition, U.S.-based authors dominated the overall TPE research. But authors from Asian institutions have a greater presence in Asia-focused studies testing the hypothesis. TPE research exemplifies Asian perspectives adding to a globally popular theory. Insights drawn from these findings and new directions for future research are offered.},

A crucial turn took place in the late 1960s, stimulated by policy developments in the Finnish Broadcasting Company (YLE), and leading to a unique paradigm and to debates with proponents of paradigms produced later. By the late 1980s, many of the old divergences and contrasts have disappeared and an understanding has emerged that no single perspective can dominate the field. Yet there is interest in the prospects of a more synthetic approach, for which intellectual stimulation is coming from the crossroads of the three main disciplinary variants in European mass communication studies\textemdash{}Euro-American, French and German respectively.},

  abstract = {This book offers the first detailed intellectual history of communication study, from its beginnings in late nineteenth-century critiques of corporate capitalism and the burgeoning American wireline communications industry, to contemporary information theory and poststructuralist accounts of communicative activity. Schiller identifies a problematic split between manual and intellectual labor that outlasts each of the field's major conceptual departures, and from this vital perspective builds a rigorous critical survey of work aiming to understand the nexus of media, ideology, and information in a society. Looking closely at the thought of John Dewey, C. Wright Mills, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Daniel Bell, and others, Schiller carefully maps the transformation of ideas about communication and culture as issues of corporate power, mass persuasion, cultural imperialism, and information expansion succeed one another in prominence. Bringing his analysis of communication theory into the present, Schiller concludes by limning a unitary model of society's cultural/informational production, one that broadens the concept of "labor" to include all forms of human self-activity. Powerful, challenging, and original, Theorizing Communication: A History offers a brilliantly constructed overview of the history of communication study, and will interest scholars working in the field as well as those working in critical theory, cultural studies, and twentieth-century intellectual history.},

  abstract = {Despite its centrality in the production, circulation and consumption of contemporary celebrity culture, the detailed study of television fame has occupied a relatively marginal place in star/celebrity studies. Early work on television fame originated from film studies, or was generally defined against the concept of film stardom. This meant that it was often characterised negatively: the apparent specificities or qualities of TV fame were defined in pejorative terms, and it was imagined in terms of what it was not (film stardom proper). The subsequent expansion of celebrity studies has arguably placed less emphasis on the specificity of media forms and boundaries \textendash{} in part reflecting the fluid and pervasive circulation of contemporary media fame. We suggest here that this has created a conceptual context in which the real complexities of TV fame have fallen between the analytical cracks. This article thus seeks to explore the ways in which television fame has been positioned within star/celebrity studies, while also examining how a range of historical and contemporary studies can illuminate the possibilities and challenges for the future study of TV fame.},

This study extends our understanding of Alpert in two main ways: first, by examining the earlier development of his views and career. Beginning with his 1939 biography of Emile Durkheim, we explore the early development of Alpert's views about foundational questions concerning the scientific status of sociology and social science more generally, proper social science methodology, the practical value of social science, the academic institutionalisation of sociology, and the unity-of-science viewpoint. Second, this paper illuminates Alpert's complex involvement with certain tensions in mid-century US social science that were themselves linked to major transformations in national science policy, public patronage, and unequal relations between the social and natural sciences. We show that Alpert's views about the intellectual foundations, practical relevance, and institutional standing of the social sciences were, in some important respects, at odds with his NSF policy work. Although remembered as a quantitative evangelist and advocate for the unity-of-science viewpoint, Alpert was in fact an urbane critic of natural-science envy, social scientific certainty, and what he saw as excessive devotion to quantitative methods.},

In response, this article reads scientometric data and game studies editorials, handbooks, and introductions through the lens of interdisciplinarity studies to assess game studies' status as an interdiscipline. It argues that game studies show drivers and hurdles typical for interdisciplines. Yet instead of establishing themselves as the broad umbrella interdiscipline of digital game research, they are becoming one narrow cultural studies multidiscipline within the growing and diversifying field of game research and education. Researchers from fields like human\textendash{}computer interaction or communication are abandoning game studies venues in favor of disciplinary ones\textemdash{}ironically thanks to game studies legitimizing game research. This article suggests that a design orientation and cross-disciplinary boundary objects such as middle range theories could help to broaden, deepen, and secure future interdisciplinary game research.},

  abstract = {L. Robert Kohls was recognized as one of the five most important intercultural authors in the 1991 SIETAR survey and has been referred to as '' America's Leading Interculturalist.'' This article explores the focus and influence of Kohls, providing a biography of his background, education, and professional contributions, primarily in his special interest area of developing understanding in intercultural relations and models and applications for intercultural training. Kohls' legacy is considered from multiple perspectives: (1) his contribution to intercultural training foundations as seen through the citation influence of his publications; (2) his popularization of the field of intercultural communication by putting complex theories into practical, applicable resources and training packages; (3) his promotion of cultural-specific analysis and understanding of American and Korean cultures; (4) his being a life-long learner and author, continuing to develop many unfinished course/training materials for publication up to his death; and (5) his being a trainer who motivated and modeled empathy and compassion through his art of living and serving. A preliminary reading list of Kohls' publications is provided to supplement this overview of an exemplary intercultural statesman, trainer, and caring human being. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The significant intercultural training and publishing career of L. Robert Kohls' is overviewed. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Kohls' training philosophy (empathy and compassion), know-how, and exercises are highlighted. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Kohls' culture-specific understanding of American and Korean cultures and values are reviewed. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Kohls' intercultural relations legacy is noted by listing both published and unpublished works. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The practical, training resources Kohls wrote helped popularize intercultural communication.},

@article{havers_right-wing_2003,
  abstract = {In the decades following his death in 1980, there has been a revival of interest in the political implications of Marshall McLuhan's works. This new literature suggests that the entirety of McLuhan's works represents a subtle critique of liberal capitalism and a call for a new emancipatory vision. For this reason, many scholars working in this literature see McLuhan as a man of the left. Although there is a discernible anti-capitalistic politics in McLuhan's works, this article will argue against the position that his anti-capitalism is rooted in leftism. Indeed, McLuhan critiques the liberal, individualistic and capitalistic print age from the right-wing side of the political spectrum. McLuhan's writings on tribalism reveal the hope that a new right-wing postmodern community will be reconstructed. Such a retrieval of the past is postmodern, since technology and myth are the forces which, McLuhan hoped, would construct this new right-wing political space.},

  abstract = {Though not as well-known as other of his writings, Robert K. Merton's communications research represents an important body of work. From 1941, when he first joined forces with Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University, through 1949, when he published his last articles in the area, Merton was active in the overlapping fields of propaganda, public opinion, and communications research. He codified methods, formulated middle range concepts, and composed a small but distinctive corpus that remains useful for contemporary study. Borrowing one of Merton's own concepts, this essay argues that his communications research was serendipitous\textemdash{}an unplanned, surprising, but highly productive episode in his nine-decade 'life of learning'. Not only was communications research the vehicle through which he and Lazarsfeld initially forged their famous partnership, it also helped Merton advance his own sociological thinking and yielded some of the best work on mass media published before 1950. Following the logic of the idea of serendipity, I trace the development of Merton's communications research from his unplanned preparation in the 1930s, through the structured opportunity he ambivalently embraced working with Lazarsfeld during the war, and on to some of the more significant consequences that followed.},

With a focus on the United States, I identify several discourses in both the intellectual and broader socio-political context that were contemporary with the research and whose influences can be seen in these seminal studies. In particular: organizational theory\textemdash{}of the Marxist variety, a critique of professionalism, and the social construction of reality; as well as a broad rejection of institutional authority and a liberal call for pluralism. Having identified these influences, I ask what sort of blind spots this historically specific intellectual constellation produced, and how these blind spots still influence the media sociology of today. I conclude that the intellectual and socio-political contexts of the newsroom studies led their authors to over-emphasize organizational constraints, and to focus narrowly on the most influential news outlets and their official sources; contemporary ethnographies have placed greater emphasis on journalistic agency and on the networked nature of newswork, though I question whether an emphasis on organizational constraints is not still politically warranted.},

@phdthesis{soukup_term_1985,
  abstract = {The uses of the word, 'medium,' in communication research from 1920 through 1940 reveal a complex background of philosophical and historical development. By examining 'medium' and its development, this study argues that communication research carries with it the traces of a varied set of philosophical assumptions, many problematic and most unexamined. This varied background to contemporary work demands that the terminology of the area of study be placed in its historical, social, and disciplinary context. During the early period of communication research, 'medium' draws on four clusters of meaning: meanings associated with physical connection, meanings associated with representatives and representation, meanings associated with social formation and a social environment, and meanings associated with a secondary, instrumental, function. Educators, writers, and communication practitioners apply 'medium' to various kinds of communication, including transportation, the press, film, radio, and even language. In the 1920s these usages are specific and illustrate clear differences of meaning; by 1940 the instrumental meaning overshadows the others, as a secondary function attached to a primary denotation. The history of the word not only illumines the history of communication studies but also helps shape this area of study and its practices.},

Once social scientists had worked out the selection procedures to deal with large and far-flung human populations, the stage was set for the scientific study of citizen behavior in national elections, as initially demonstrated by George Gallup in predicting the 1936 presidential race. This development unleashed a growing torrent of literature, which by now is simply overwhelming. The many high points in this literature could scarcely be listed, much less abstracted, in the brief compass allowed this essay. So I must invoke some severe selection principles in order to proceed.},

  abstract = {For many of the previous 100 years the role of a journalist was to find information, shape it into an accurate story and transmit it as quickly as possible to a mass audience via a mass medium. Today, information is no longer scarce, breaking news is no longer the province of professional journalists, mass media are declining in influence and news is easily personalized. Like many news organizations, journalism education programs are distinctly unprepared to respond to such deeply structural changes in the environment. Preliminary research indicates that the response to date has been primarily to expand technology training and reorient sequence and media emphasis tracks. The present study recommends a realignment of journalism education from an industry-centered model to a community-centered model as one way to re-engage journalism education in a more productive and vital role in the future of journalism. A community-centered focus could provide a way to conceptualize a reconstitution of journalism education to match that taking place in journalism beyond the university. Three examples from current journalism programs illustrate the implications of this analysis and provide an indication of future directions for realignment.},

It argues that the identity of the field of business communication and all variations thereof ought to be determined by the concep tual problematic underlying its intellectual inquiry rather than by its vocabu lary or instructional practices. On this basis, the paper advocates the view that business communication, management communication, and organizational communication are not, as suggested by the three articles, separate disciplines but interdependent areas of study nested within the domain of the mother discipline of communication. The paper concludes by making the plea for a more inclusive editorial policy that adopts an eclectic methodological stance and encourages substantive debates relating to the nature and processes of communication as constituted by the practical milieu of business.},

I examine Hoggart as a literary critic, using examples from his earliest book on Auden to show how the working-class intellectual engages with canonical literature in a 'high' art form and then I consider a range of his writings about literature to show the importance of literary criticism for Hoggart and his love of literature. This is important because love of literature and commitment to a rigorous literary critical method inform all Hoggart's writing on culture. An understanding of his literary criticism is key to appreciating his cultural analysis and can also offer a way forward at a time when the literary may have been abandoned in the quest for the popular.},

The contribution interrogates this labor/play dialectic while looking at recent literature on games being produced within the current capitalist and neoliberal system, focusing on phenomena like '' playbour'' and on key elements discussed in these theories, from the affordances and limitations of technology to the immaterial technological tools used by gamers and game makers. The article argues that looking at Caillois in relation to Marxism would provide an interesting critical perspective, one that has been underexplored by current approaches. The authors note that contemporary concerns on capitalism and games are far from being at odds with Caillois' distinction between labur and play and suggest that the influence of Marxism on Caillois' writings would provide an interesting terrain of further discussion.},

It starts with where I entered the evolution of the idea as one of his students, points out a problem that emerged as a consequence of generalising information measures from simple to complex systems, i.e. systems with many variables, shows how this problem was eventually solved, and ends with how his idea of decomposing complex systems into smaller interactions reappears in one of the most complex technologies of our time: cyberspace. While nobody could anticipate the complexities that developed since, Ashby's idea of understanding complex systems in terms of manageable interactions, which I call electronic artefacts, is actually practised today and cyberspace is again worth analysing in information theoretical terms.},

@book{simpson_science_1994,
  abstract = {In this provocative study, Christopher Simpson demonstrates how the government-funded psychological warfare programs of the Cold War years underwrote the academic studies that formed the basis for much of modern communication research. U.S. psychological warfare programs in the Philippines, Middle East and Southeast Asia became essential in the creation and survival of what is widely considered to be mainstream mass communication studies. They aided in forming the widely held preconceptions that persist today in communication studies, public opinion research, and in the types of counterinsurgency operations that are today known as "public diplomacy" and "low intensity conflict.". Science of Coercion: Communication Research and Psychological Warfare, 1945-1960 provides the first thorough examination of the role of the CIA, Pentagon, and other U.S. security agencies in the evolution of modern communication studies. Christopher Simpson contends that it is unlikely that communication research could have emerged in its present form without regular transfusions of money from U.S. military, intelligence, and propaganda agencies during the Cold War. These agencies saw mass communication as an instrument for persuading or dominating targeted groups in the United States and abroad; as a tool for improving military operations; and perhaps most fundamentally, as a means to extend U.S. influence more widely than ever before at a relatively modest cost. Communication research, in turn, became for a time the preferred method for testing and developing such techniques . Science of Coercion outlines the history of U.S. psychological warfare between 1945 and 1960, discussing the underlying theories, activities, and administrative structure of this type of communication enterprise. In the process, Simpson documents the role played by prominent mass communication researchers including Wilbur Schramm, Ithiel de Sola Pool, Samuel Stouffer, and Paul Lazarsfield to demonstrate the links between the so-called "founding fathers" of communication studies in the United States and psychological warfare programs. Drawing on long-classified documents and extensive archival research, Simpson has produced a fascinating study in the history of science and the sociology of knowledge. Science of Coercion offers valuable insights into the dynamics of ideology and the social psychology of mass communication. It will provide informative reading for scholars and students of communication, the history of science, and social psychology, as well as the general reader.},

An example of this is philosopher Benedict of Spinoza's ideas on the power of images and the importance of emotions to explain human behavior. This article delves into how Spinoza's ideas have been transmitted to classic public relations authors such as Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays through the works of their masters and their mentors: George Santayana, who was one of Lippmann's philosophy professors at Harvard, and Sigmund Freud, an uncle of Bernays whose psychoanalysis theory shaped Bernays' approach to persuasion. In contrast to these public relations masters of persuasion who had a pessimistic view of the human condition, Spinoza's Ethics is based on a positive anthropology of man that squares well with contemporary and more ethical relationship-building approaches to public relations.},

  abstract = {More than fifty years after Erich Fromm's The Sane Society was first published, it remains an important work, surprisingly contemporary in scope, with particular relevance to scholars working in social theory and media studies. Fromm's primary emphasis is on evaluating the sanity of contemporary western societies, which he suggests often deny its citizens' basic human needs of productive activity, self-actualisation, freedom, and love. He suggests that the mental health of a society cannot be assessed in an abstract manner but must focus on specific economic, social, and political factors at play in any given society and should consider whether these factors contribute to insanity or are conducive to mental stability. Ultimately The Sane Society provides a radical critique of democratic capitalism that goes below surface symptoms to get to the root causes of alienation and to suggest ways to transform contemporary societies to further the productive activities of its citizens. Fromm envisions the refashioning of democratic capitalist societies based on the tenants of communitarian socialism, which stresses the organisation of work and social relations between its citizens rather than on issues of ownership.},

Bernays, the author of several pioneering PR books, has profoundly influenced how critical scholars have conceived of public relations. Bernays deceptively claimed that Walter Lippmann provided the theory and that he provided the practice, creating the false impression that Lippmann was an apologist for PR. Lippmann actually denounced government and corporate publicity agents as propagandists and censors. Yet critical PR scholarship has uncritically accepted and amplified Bernays' misrepresentation. This article seeks to correct this error by comparing the key texts: Lippmann's Public Opinion (1922) and Bernays' Crystallizing Public Opinion (1923).},

Attempts to apply Shannon's theory to our field are reviewed, along with previous critiques, and it is recommended that future uses of Shannon's theory adopt a more methodologically rigorous approach.

The challenge coincides with the influence of complex modernist and postmodernist ideas related to notions of culture, ideology, and power, and the increasing relevance of the production of meaning in the study of social formations. Its success is based on the ability to reflect on the role of intellectuals vis-a-vis the instrumental rationality of an administrative or corporate discourse and to reconceptualize the relations of media, communication, and society.},

  abstract = {In the UK we have recently witnessed a series of attacks on the overall project of cultural studies, both in the popular press and, within the academy, by scholars associated with the more established disciplines of sociology and anthropology. The critiques variously argue that cultural studies has led us into a political 'dead end' (in particular, in its emphasis on the study of cultural consumption); has abandoned 'politics' altogether (at least, in one definition of the term); has done little more than reinvent (in ignorance) the old (and indeed outmoded) theoretical wheels of an earlier intellectual tradition, and/or that, in general, the 'excesses' of its project have only confirmed the worst fears of those who were opposed to it in the first place. In these critiques it is argued that it is (somehow) both time to move 'beyond' cultural studies altogether, and time to return to the more secure disciplinary foundations and rigorous methodological procedures of sociology, and/or political economy and anthropology. This article considers the theoretical and political occasions of this interesting (hyper?) critical phenomenon, and considers whether, notwithstanding the very real current problems and divisions within cultural studies itself, the contributions of cultural studies over the last twenty years have now so transformed our field of study that the critics' proposed return to 'The Good Old Ways' may simply no longer be possible (even if it were desirable).},

Prior to World War II, Allport, Katz, and Likert made pioneering contributions to understanding issues relevant to society, to the science of social psychology, and to methods of attitude measurement and poll design. In response to World War II, each of the three pursued research topics more immediately connected to the war effort. Similar to other prominent social psychologists, Allport, Katz, and Likert were able to parlay their prewar reputations into significant, high-level roles in the service of the World War II effort. In turn, these successes helped to lay the foundation for a postwar boom in social psychology that had implications for training in and research on social psychology. Nonetheless, social psychology's and society's utilization of the knowledge gained during World War II appears to have been less than optimal.},

This gives it a particular methodological significance in relating the extraordinariness of imaginative literature to the ordinariness of cultural process. It is employed particularly to show the significance of literature for the articulation of alternatives to dominant world views, and thus to the politics of social change. Williams's different formulations of the concept are discussed in terms of their ways of relating reflexive experience to institutional structures and in relation to the genetic structuralism of Goldmann and Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and cultural field. Three types of criticisms are considered, which have in common the contention that the concept is unclear. Operationalized in analysing literature and its symbols, it can contribute towards clarification of the complexity of the processes of reflexive communication of experience which are at the root of social order and change.},

  abstract = {Throughout his long career Stuart Hall has personified a shifting range of political-intellectual positionalities, responding to the changing historical conjuncture in the West since the late 1950s. From his engagement with the New Left to the generation of new spaces for critical intellectual intervention in the 1970s (as embodied by the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies) to the tightening up of such spaces as a consequence of the neoliberal ascendancy (which Hall himself theorized through his analysis of Thatcherism) from the 1980s onwards, the role of the intellectual/academic has changed significantly throughout this period, as universities have become increasingly corporatized. This article tracks this evolution by tracing the paradoxical fate of cultural studies as an intellectual project and academic formation, and Hall's ultimate distancing from it at the end of his life.},

The discussion considers Hall's life as political activist\textemdash{}a leading spokesperson for Britain's New Left Movement\textemdash{}and scholar, namely his leadership in re-imagining the ways that society, social movements, race, gender, colonialism, and popular culture might be studied. Hall's academic life grew out of his growing racial awareness and his political engagement with key events of the post-World War II era. In seeking a third analytic space, driven neither by Soviet communist nor western capitalist values, Hall took up a traditional socialist path that would lead him into emerging intellectual formations in 1950s Britain. His academic life, which followed, would incorporate the wider range of concerns in the world, giving him global appeal as a thinker and writer.},

Theoretically, the study builds on the sociology of culture and education in the tradition of Bourdieu and some of his successors, and its methodological design is that of a comprehensive survey of the entire corpus of academic theses produced within the Norwegian music field. On this basis, the authors examine what forms of popular music have been included and excluded respectively, how this aesthetic and cultural expansion has found its legitimate scholarly expression, and which structural forces seem to govern the processes of academisation of popular music in the Norwegian context. The results show that popular music to a large extent has been successfully academised, but also that this process has led to some limitations of academic openness as well as the emergence of new power hierarchies.},

A signature motif of his life and writings, the notion of anonymity is ambivalent, signaling both invisibility and success. The article traces this motif from its treatment in Kracauer's novel Ginster to the role the author ascribes to it in his correspondence with Theodor W. Adorno, to the posthumous fate of his works on both sides of the Atlantic. A comparative reception history shows the different valences of Kracauer's name in German and Anglo-American scholarship, particularly in the history of film studies. The article situates the trope of anonymity at the heart of Kracauer's oeuvre, where it helps define a nonsovereign subject in response to modernity.},

Ultimately, red-baiting tactics defeated the policy initiatives outlined in the Blue Book and the media reform movement was largely contained. The following analysis draws from archival materials to illuminate the resulting arrangement for US broadcasters.},

  abstract = {Between the 1950s and the 1980s, the BBC's internal Audience Research Unit compiled up to 700 Audience Research reports for television a year, attempting to cover the complete spectrum of BBC TV programming. This article considers the form, value and possible future application of this material, reflections inspired by my own use of the collection when researching BBC adaptations of theatrical classics in order to examine the use of space in these dramas in the 1970s; the spaces that programmes were made in, the spaces represented onscreen, and viewers' spatial understanding of these programmes. In this piece I shall describe the form that the Audience Research Reports took, demonstrate why they are of use to historians, and then explain two methodologies that I have used in my work; forming conclusions through looking at the full extent of reports for one form of drama (versions of classic stage plays recorded on location on Outside Broadcast) spread across a number of years; and decoding audience's reactions through establishing what was left unsaid in these reports.},

Findings - Using sociology, anthropology, and clinical psychology to explain how and why consumers buy, motivation research provided business with valuable information, and, in the long run, began today's consumer behavior field of study.

Analyzing the talk as a discursive practice demonstrates both the value of discourse analysis and some contradictions of the policy process. The talk treated cable as an autonomous technology and consequently obscured political and economic conditions while exaggerating cable's uniqueness; these characteristics encouraged the reconceptualization of cable in the policy arena in a way that, in combination with several other forces, led to the reregulation of cable and its subsequent growth. The discourse thus helped shape an institution that it failed to describe.},

This article also examines Thompson's contributions to historiography, his engagement with the contextualised histories of ordinary people and their contributions to the making of the public sphere in 18th-century England. This article argues that the contributions made by these two theorists enable a critique of structures and a re-centring of agency, both of which are critical to a renewal of communication for social change theory.},

  abstract = {The aims and status of arts and culture criticism are currently up for revision and under attack, according to a whole host of indicators. It is clear that the reasons for the current situation include the worldwide recession, the recent drop in print advertising revenues and, more fundamentally, the declining circulations attributable to reluctant consumers of print media. These developments have brought forth ontological, if not existential, questions about the purpose and worth of criticism in the age of WordPress blogospheres and a perceived democratization of criticism. Despite the 'brave new world' rhetoric underpinning the debate, precedents and some of the solutions to these 'new media' problems are to be found in old historical lessons. This article focuses one such case study. Examining Sight and Sound's 1960 'Critical Question', a reaction to Cahiers du cin{\'e}ma but, more importantly, an intervention into a key debate on the purpose of criticism instructs us about the construction of particular, Lionel Trilling-inspired kind of 'liberal' taste that would come to define Sight and Sound's part in the establishment of a 'broad church' national film culture, a role it plays to this day.},

We argue that although this dramatic and somewhat romantic simplification may be pedagogically useful in introductory courses, it may prove a significant impediment to further theoretical refinement and progress in advanced scholarship. We analyze the citation patterns of 20,736 scholarly articles in five communication journals with special attention to the 200 most frequently cited papers in an effort to provide an alternative six-stage model of, we argue, cumulative media effects theories for the period 1956\textendash{}2005.},

  abstract = {This paper is a comparative analysis of the telecommunications policy-making process in China and India. Adopting an institutionalist perspective and multi-streams framework, the paper analyzes the formal structures, rule-making procedures and interest groups involved in telecommunications policy-making in the two countries, in terms of their evolution over the last two decades. Though the two systems began this period with a somewhat similar ministerial-bureaucratic decision-making model, and faced similar problems of assimilating new interest groups and responding to international pressures, the paper finds that the decision systems in the two countries evolved in significantly different directions. China's telecommunications decision-making is significantly affected by the macro level political rearrangement and is more likely to be non-incremental. On the other hand, confronted by an increasingly litigious environment and a more fractious interest group culture, India represents a somewhat classical textbook case of incremental policy making. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in both countries, including institutional capacity and excessive regulatory deference to political authority. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} From a comparative lens, the impact of institutional endowment on policy making is illustrated. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The telecom policy making in India is incremental while China is more likely to be non-incremental. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Challenges such as excessive regulatory deference to political power remain in both countries.},

Entwined humanistic and posthumanistic impulses create space for voices, labors, bodies, and other material things that deserve our attention. At the narrative and moral core of the story is a group of remarkable yet unsung women who, from the late 1930s through the early 1950s, helped to invent practices, produce research, shape thinking, and establish social relationships that laid foundations for media and communication study in the United States and the world. These women are the figures we call the founding mothers of our field. Focusing on the Paul Lazarsfeld-led Office of Radio Research (ORR) and the Bureau of Applied Social Research (the Bureau) from 1937 to 1949, we attend to four representative women\textemdash{}Herta Herzog, Hazel Gaudet, Thelma Ehrlich Anderson, and Rose K.

The interviews start with family background, early days, and professional dreams, before moving into the world of ideas. They look back to dealing with decisions over which graduate school to attend, main academic teachers, and the state of the discipline at the time, and then continue with both the intellectual and the institutional steps which led to fame and recognition within and, in almost all cases, even outside the field. Last but not least, all interviewees were asked about the discipline itself: What is communication all about? Is there a kind of core, although the discipline is highly diverse in methods, theories, and objects of study (Stanfill, 2012)? What is the reputation of the subject today? Is communication still seen as an '' academic Taiwan'' (claiming all of China as its own tiny island; Peters, 1986, p. 544), or, similarly unfavorably, as a stepchild that is tolerated by U.S. university administrators only because it helps to pay the bill for the departments they really care about? What about the '' rest'' of the world, and what about the '' big unknowns'' (Sonia Livingstone), such as China, for example, where they seem to open a new university every week? These interviews are not only a source for future historians of the discipline and a blueprint for junior scholars that strive for a professorship, but also a document of the early 21st century: Where did communication come from? What does the worldwide landscape of this fast growing academic enterprise look like today? And where do we go from here\textemdash{}let's say, until 2030?},

Contrasted with coverage of politics as issues, the framing of politics as a strategic game is marked by features such as winning and losing as the central concern and a focus on how candidates or parties are doing in opinion polls. The pervasiveness of such framing is, however, disputed since (1) the way in which the frames are conceptualized and operationalized differs significantly; and (2) while some use terms such as 'game frame' and 'strategy frame' as synonymous, others argue that there is a conceptual difference between them. Against this background, this article reviews research on the media's framing of politics as a strategic game, what concepts have been used, and how they have been operationalized; and suggests a synthesis and ways of improving conceptual clarity and comparability in research on the media's use of strategy and/or game frames.},

This book, published in the post-World War II consumer boom, exposed a mass audience to motivational research at a time when advertisers used new techniques and a new medium. Yet The Hidden Persuaders was highly criticized and became a scapegoat for purportedly promoting subliminal techniques. Nonetheless, the book helped shape public opinion, advertising regulation, and advertising research and practice. This paper provides a historical approach to Packard's contribution and ideas in the context of recent theoretical insights into psychological processing and new persuasion practices.

@phdthesis{fackler_hutchins_1982,
  abstract = {The Commission on Freedom of the Press, chaired by Robert M. Hutchins, met from 1944 to 1946 and issued its summary report in 1947. Social Responsibility Theory of the press was thus given its most articulate statement to that time. The years prior to the meetings of these thirteen Commissioners were ripe with challenge for traditional democratic theory. A new Weltanschauung\textendash{}scientific naturalism\textendash{}was riding the crest of a new wave of empiricism, pragmatism, instrumentalism, sociological jurisprudence, and 'value-free' social science. World events, however, demanded a strong moral defense of traditional democracy. The moral neutrality of scientific naturalism offered little rationale for the struggle against fascism. The Thirties, therefore, saw a variety of movements attempting to recover a moral base: The Harvard humanists, the Southern Agrarians, the Neo-Thomists, various social theorists typified by Pitirim Sorokin, and the resurgence of metaphysical philosophy at the University of Chicago. The latter was primarily the work of Robert Hutchins and his associate Mortimer Adler. Besides Hutchins, were the other twelve Commissioners involved in the resurgence of moral theory? Were the deliberations and conclusions of Commission proceedings influenced by this struggle in worldview? The Commissioners appealed for foundational presuppositions to three ways of understanding the world. The classical humanists (Hutchins and others) looked to the 'Great Conversation' of Western tradition for the moral justification of democracy. The Christian humanists (Niebuhr, Hocking, Shuster) rested their case for moral values on transcendent authority. The empirical humanists (Merriam, Lasswell, others) fully accepted the new scientism but insisted on moral authority for reasons their worldview could not justify. The Commission's dominant voices were the classical and the Christian humanists. They participated more aggressively in Commission debates; many of their ideas were reflected in the reports of 1947. Social responsibility theory of the press, therefore, is rightly viewed as an effort to recover a moral base for freedom of speech, a moral base strong enough to speak to the modern era of the virtues of traditional democracy.},

From the beginning of my graduate studies at Northwestern University in the 1960s into the next century, Harold's guidance has been indispensable. His idea of bridging islands of theory has provided many of us with a broad, integrated vision of social science. His workman-like approach to scholarship has provided us with the tools needed to contribute to the field. As a broad theorist, Harold inspired us to devote a lifetime in pursuit of knowledge. As a mentor, he imparted the essential skills of writing for publication, presenting at professional meetings, teaching and advising, and contributing to the profession. Above all, his values of interdisciplinary and responsible scholarship have been a hallmark of my own research and project leadership. My work on simulation reflects these values as well, with regard to research platforms and classroom learning. Indeed, a recent article in this journal owes much to Harold's influence (Druckman \& Ebner, 2008).},

  abstract = {This paper is an attempt to trace how the concepts of intuition and duration as formulated by the philosopher Henri Bergson have permeated areas of film studies where he is not typically considered to be an important figure, such as film criticism. After the publication of the English language version of Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution in 1911, the analytic philosopher Bertrand Russell published a polemic attack against him. This disagreement between the two can be seen to focus on the proper role of analysis. Where Bergson believed that through intuition we can come to see something of the wholeness of a thing, Russell believed this to be a preposterous claim. I examine how this fissure between the two concerning the importance of intuition and analysis has reoccurred in the debate between David Bordwell and V.F. Perkins concerning the former's book, Making Meaning: Inference and Rhetoric in the Interpretation of Cinema (1989), as well as how Bergson's concept of duration has influenced the early film theorist and film-maker Jean Epstein. Interestingly, this influence has again come under attack by another analytic thinker: Malcolm Turvey.},

In contrast with the heroic narrative, constructed retrospectively, that prioritizes cultural studies' approaches to audiences, the author suggests that this rich and interdisciplinary history offers many fruitful ways forward as the agenda shifts from mass media to new media audiences. Although audience research has long been characterized by struggles between critical and administrative schools of communication, and between opposed perspectives on the relation of the individual to society, Katz and Lazarsfeld's work, and subsequent work by Katz and his collaborators, suggests possibilities for convergence, or at least productive dialogue, across hitherto polarized perspectives as researchers collectively seek to understand how, in their everyday lives, people can, and could, engage with media to further democratic participation in the public sphere.},

Lazarsfeld is seen as an institutional innovator in higher education, having established in Vienna in 1925 the first social science research center of its kind in the world, and later the Bureau of Applied Social Research at Columbia University. The structural situation of the Bureau is examined in detail, showing how Lazarsfeld developed the role of entrepreneurial scholar to finance its operations. The article examines Lazarsfeld's psychological makeup, which meshed well with the world of business as well as the Bureau's need for commercial fund-raising.

  abstract = {Twenty-five years ago, Horace Newcomb and Paul Hirsch proposed a model for studying television as a cultural forum, as the most common reference point for public issues and concerns, particularly in American society. Over the last decade, the internet has emerged as a new communicative infrastructure and cultural forum on a global scale. Revisiting and reworking Newcomb and Hirsch's classic contribution, this article: first, advances a model of the internet as a distinctive kind of medium comprising different communicative genres \textemdash{} one-to-one, one-to-many as well as many-to-many communication; and, second, the article presents an empirical baseline study of their current prevalence. The findings suggest that while blogs, social network sites and other recent genres have attracted much public as well as scholarly attention, ordinary media users may still be more inclined to engage in good old-fashioned broadcasting and interpersonal interaction. Despite a constant temptation to commit prediction, future research is well advised to ask how old communicative practices relate to new media.},

  abstract = {This article traces the development in Britain of research on information and communications in relation to trends in Sociology and this discipline's relations with Cultural Studies. It observes at the outset the seminal contribution of Daniel Bell's conception of Post-Industrial Society, characterizing it as blending theory with empirical observation while providing an account of the most consequential features of change. Sociology in the UK during the 1980s largely ignored macro-level analysis and focused on work and employment, took its starting point as opposition to the technological determinism associated with this first wave enthusiasm for the 'microelectronics revolution', and produced localized and textured studies. Manuel Castells' conception of the Network Society, while distinctive, signalled a return to the scale and scope offered by Bell, notably in being a macro analysis that combined theory and empirical evidence. Castells' contribution coincided with a second wave of technological enthusiasm associated especially with the Internet. Alongside this Sociology in Britain has experienced the rise of Cultural Studies, a field that has competed for important parts of what might have been considered Sociology's terrain. Indeed, Cultural Studies has outpaced Sociology in response to recent changes in the information domain. Its emergence expressed little concern with technological determinism, embracing 'virtuality' and being more open to the exploration of expanding culture. Nonetheless, Cultural Studies remains methodologically flawed while, like so much sociological research on ICTs and information, seemingly incapable of combining theory and empirical evidence that identify and explain the major contours of change.},

Using a combination of content analysis and text mining-based semantic network analysis, this paper reviews 272 articles on Asian communication technology published in SSCI communication journals between 1995 and 2014. Our results show that East Asia was the most studied region in this field. Internet was the most popular keyword, and it was also the most studied communication technology followed by mobile phone, information communication technologies, and social media. Adopting a variety of methodologies and balancing between qualitative and quantitative, most of these studies took the psychological micro-level scope. When it comes to technology\textendash{}context relation, the majority of research took the technology determinism perspective. Asian-based scholars leaned to technology determinism and are more likely to see technology as a change force for Asia, whereas the Western-based counterparts viewed Asian context as a filter and took macro-level scope in their research more often. The technology\textendash{}context relationship and regional diversity discussed in this paper also shed light on future studies to make theoretical contributions to this important research field.},

We aim to answer the question by mapping research themes, theorization, and methodology of Internet studies based on 27,000+ articles published in Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts \& Humanities Citation Index journals over the last 10 years. In analyzing the articles, we adopt a `bottom-up' approach classifying keywords of the Internet studies without any a priori categorization to identify the boundaries, major divisions, and basic elements of the field talis qualis. The research strategy results in a number of expected, as well as surprising, patterns and trends. Internet studies have evolved into a viable field that has witnessed a booming decade. The field is clustered around four primary research themes: e-Health, e-Business, e-Society, and Human Technology Interactions. Two or three sub-themes with different research foci and methodologies emerge within each theme. The evolution of popular keywords in each sub-theme further shows that the field has become more concerned with intricate relationships between Internet use and specific behaviors/attitudes/effects; Internet usage patterns have increasingly attracted research attention; and network perspectives and approaches have become popular. Internet studies in the past decade have been modestly theorized. Established research methods (e.g., survey, experiment, and content analysis) still prevail in the Internet studies reviewed.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is an intellectual history and critical analysis of medium theory investigations of communication technologies. The more common approaches to viewing technology as savior or slayer are a consequence of the technological sublime in our time of technological saturation. It is argued that the way to break out of this technological sublime-induced grand dichotomy is to follow the lead of medium theorists who investigate the unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture, and to follow the lead of marxists who place technological developments within the larger dynamic of a system based on the drive for profit. Intellectual influences and theoretical implications of the work of prominent scholars such as Harold Adams Innis, Herbert Marshall McLuhan, Joshua Meyrowitz, James Carey, Walter Ong, and Neil Postman are analyzed throughout the dissertation. The main contribution of medium theorists has been their ability to analyze the impact of unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture; their collective weakness has been a tendency to slight important social factors such as the drive for profit, inequality, and class. To correct this problem, it is argued that medium theory should be merged with an activist marxist tradition. A synthesis of activist marxism and medium theory, it is argued, will give to marxist scholars a better sense of unintended consequences and to medium theorists a better sense of the drive for profit, inequality, and class. Finally, it is argued that scholarship in general, and marxist/medium theory scholarship in particular, is most fruitful when scholars are actively aware of, and engaged in, significant struggles of the day. Just as activist marxists argue for theoretically informed activism, scholarship would benefit from activist informed theory. It is at the point of praxis, theory informed action and action informed theory, that thought and action converge to enhance understanding of our world and to make the world a better place.},

Developing largely out of literary criticism, this line of British research has bifurcated, with one line moving toward cultural analysis and the other toward a more traditional social-scientific model with particular emphasis on class and economic structures as independent variables. This paper provides an introduction to the body of cultural research and theory, and indirectly, to the growing corpus of Marxist communication study throughout the world.},

  abstract = {The concept of mass goes back a long way to characterize a society that consists of people somehow connected by communication while, at the same time, also dispersed in space and essentially detached from one another. Mass has also been a pejorative for critics of modern capitalist society and its culture. In the years after World War II, this latter use of the term became the target of a broadside attack by several highly credentialed scholars, who questioned its value as an analytic tool. This paper, starting with Ferdinand T{\"o}nnies, offers a brief overview of both the origins of the concept of mass and its subsequent refinement by French, German, and American sociologists into the mid-1930s. Distinguishing between its ideological connotations and the analytic use of the term helps us to focus on the most general and persistent effects of mass communication: expanding the range of common experience and making people more responsive to distant events. This effect is magnified by the ubiquity of mass media; practically no one, not even those who scorn them, can altogether escape their influence.},

This paper puzzles over the lack of reference \textendash{} by McLuhan, his mentors, and his critics \textendash{} to an earlier group of British thinkers (from Shaftesbury to Adam Smith) who deliberated over the differences among the arts. Their treatises on how the mind processes visual and auditory information remarkably foreshadow McLuhan's assertion that the media constrain how we think and feel. Present-day debate over the effects of new media technology, as well as current theories of reception, reflect McLuhan's stimulating (though exasperating) insights. His footprints also point to cognitive science and, of course, to globalism.},

Still, in the era of globalization, internationalistic agendas have to be radicalized, opened up also to non-Western media thought, setting out from existing regional modernities and transformations. Thus, globalization calls for regional, not universalistic epistemologies and for cross-disciplinary, not intra-disciplinary research efforts. The chapter develops these arguments, first by recapitulating the criticism of the media and development paradigm \textendash{} an early theory of media and social change. This is followed up by a summary report on media and global inequalities in the post-Cold War period, suggesting that the relations between media, politics and economy develop contrary to the prescriptions of received models. This leads to a reinforced questioning of the very distinctions between, e.g., politics, economy and culture in media studies, as illustrated by examples from case studies of recent developments in new democracies and (neo)authoritarian systems.},

  abstract = {Research on media and mass communication has been in a state of constant flux for some 50 years. Scholars in the Humanities have traditionally studied the meaning of human expression in language, philosophy, the Arts and literature. Social scientists have focused on the relations between media institutions and other institutions, not least political ones. With the so-called 'cultural turn' in the 1980s, media scholars' interest shifted to the role of media in the development of culture, on the potential of media to generate meaning in a broader sense, and on the adaptation of media messages to culturally dominant forms of understanding. Today, the field is characterized by extreme diversity and extensive specialization. Studies on the systems level are few. At the same time, contemporary multicultural and global societies raise more complex issues than ever before. Given the high degree of specialization, scholars in the field may not be exposed to the impulses needed for them to be able to formulate incisive research problems. For the discipline to produce new insights and new knowledge requires collaboration - within the discipline, but above all collaboration across academic as well as national frontiers},

  abstract = {Fred Casmir's third culture building (TCB) framework made a major theoretical contribution to communication studies. Casmir conceptualized the framework as an active process whereby different cultural groups come together to form a third culture between them. The third culture then becomes a common ground for all participants; a cognitive space that incorporates elements of both cultures and yet remains separate and distinct. Third culture building is a departure from adoption (the process of taking on the cultural mores of another) or adaptation (modifying one's cultural mores to better fit those of another), and achieved through deliberate development in an extended process, during which all participants gain an understanding of, and appreciation for, one another. In this essay, the authors review the life and work of Fred Casmir \textendash{} a leading figure in establishing intercultural communication as a specific area of study. Next the authors discuss the ideological foundations, intended use, key applications and heuristic value of Casmir's third culture building framework.},

  abstract = {While having a solid foundation in philosophy, Walter J. Ong did not identify with any philosophical school or movement, preferring to interpret philosophy simply as love of wisdom, which is best pursued not by logic and treatise, but by rhetoric and conversation. Beginning during his formative years at Saint Louis University in the 1940s, he integrated metaphysics and communication, suggesting that the focus of philosophy should be not on the idea but on being. It is within these perspectives that Ong probed issues that later became identified with media ecology. Thomism provided a '' furniture of mind'' to weigh post-Hegelian dialectic and to probe the implications of existentialistic dialogue (Jaspers, Camus-Sartre, Marcel); to phenomenologically explore personalist interiority and encounter (Lavelle, Buber, Hopkins); to interpret human thought within the context of cosmic time and evolution (Teilhard); to consider speech philosophy as an alternative to Ramist and Cartesian methodology (Rosenstock-Huessy); and to promulgate an oral hermeneutic that contextualizes concept within being (Bakhtin, Rosenstock-Huessy). The argument of this essay is supported by substantial quotation of previously unpublished materials from the Walter J. Ong archival collection at Saint Louis University.},

A total of 131 articles were coded for general information about journals, primary topic/context of the study, use of theories or models, research methods, units of analysis/types of sample, and countries or locations. Findings showed that the number of mobile communication-related studies increased over the time period of interest. Scholars examined uses and users' characteristics of mobile communication as well as the effects of mobile media on everyday life. Most studies used quantitative methods such as survey of the general population. Theories or theoretical models were not frequently used in mobile communication research. Regarding the usage of theories or theoretical models, about half of mobile communication studies (48.1\%) used theories and/or models as theoretical frameworks. Implications for improving this field of research are specifically discussed.},

Fears about the media effect on the behaviour of readers became recurring phenomena \textendash{} in some cases provoking reactions characterised as a moral panic. These periodic outbursts of disquiet can be best understood as panics about the potential impact of the media on public morality. Such reactions were not simply media panics but panics about the effects of the media. The focus of anxiety was not on any particular issue but on the threat to moral authority posed by the media on the outlook and behaviour of the public. By its very existence the media appeared to represent a potential threat to the moral order. Exploring the moral dimension of this reaction is essential for the study of moral panics.},

The main argument is that what has been frequently ignored is the supranational dimension of the term European'. Thus, while the field of European film studies has witnessed a number of significant shifts in emphasis (most pertinently the refocusing from art cinema towards popular film genres), the core debate still primarily centres on national cinemas. The article then suggests engaging in areas that exemplify interconnectedness between national cinemas. These include patterns of inter-European migration and issues of multiculturalism; industrial practices such as co-productions; as well as localized strategies of receiving foreign films through mechanisms of translation and adaptation.},

It spurred an entire literature of academic research both about \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} and the idea of technology assessment more generally. Understanding the legislative history and implementation of the Technology Assessment Act is crucial not just for scholarship, though. \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} was a blueprint for institutionalizing politically accountable technology assessment. Even as technologies advance at rapid rates, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} still offers valuable lessons that scholars and policy-makers alike ought to glean. This paper places \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} in a contemporary context of (institutionalized) technology assessment. It contributes to a better understanding of OTA's origins by tracing its lineage to a set of federal reports beginning in 1929. It then analyzes OTA's response to pragmatic implementation questions of how to strike a balance between speed, depth, scope, and temporal focus. Lastly, it uses a public values framework to critique OTA's failure to adequately incorporate participatory elements into its processes.},

  abstract = {The focus of the article is on the author's experience as learner and teacher. The task of preparing law students for their professional life is compared to that of teaching undergraduates who, in the uniquely strenuous College of the University of Chicago, are interested in books and ideas and are not im\- mediately job-driven. Whereas in the law school setting the author, like other law professors, worked alone, in the College he worked with a staff of colleagues who shared in the choice of readings and in lectures to the entire student body-altogether, in the author's view, a more demanding task for the teacher. Graduate education in sociology is again different: the student is an apprentice professional, but there is no clear road toward professional prac\- tice; the faculty member as mentor on the disse:rtation helps pilot the appren\- tice through the cross-currents of conflict in the field and in the particular department. Teaching undergraduates in Harvard College, the author reports, involved tasks different from those faced in the College of the University of Chicago. Rather than working, as at Chicago, with a staff of presumptive equals, at Harvard the author recruited advanced graduate students and junior (and on occasion, senior) faculty whom he treated as colleagues, but whom Harvard undergraduates tended to deprecate as mere "section men," i.e. teaching assistants. The author details efforts to overcome what was 30 years ago the fabled yet quite real pose of "Harvard indifference"-a lack of engagement with subject matter and with noncelebrity faculty. The Harvard colleague group worked to get students to do small pieces of fieldwork, not merely as exercises, but out of interest in a topic and an idea. When with the rise of a radical student-faculty "movement" many undergraduates became less "cool," the problems of teaching subtly changed. Always, the author notes, teaching is contextual and often needs to work against the prevailing tide.},

We do so with a festive issue that comes together with our first free open access top articles in three areas that readers have sought us out for: postfeminism, television beyond textual analysis and cultural labour in the creative industries. The issue opens with freshly commissioned introductory essays to these three thematic areas by key authors in those fields. In addition, the issue offers new articles showcasing the range of the broad field of cultural studies today, including pieces on the politics of co-working, punk in China, Black British women on YouTube, trans-pedagogy and fantasy sports gameplay, featuring work by emerging as well as established scholars. Our editorial introduction to this celebratory issue offers reflections on how both the journal and the field of cultural studies have developed, and on our thoughts and ambitions for the future within the current conjuncture as we 'move on' as a new editorial team.},

He was one of the editors of the landmark book Radical and Philosophical Theory in Marketing, published in 1987, which sought to develop alternative modes of theorizing and conceptualizing both marketing practice and the consuming subject. The continuation of that wider project eventually lead to the foundation of Consumption Markets \& Culture, the journal for which Fuat served as Editor-in-Chief for its initial 10 years of existence. Fuat also co-authored the book Consuming People (1998) in collaboration with Nikhilesh Dholakia. By that stage, in particular following his seminal article on the re-enchantment of consumption, written with Alladi Venkatesh, Fuat had helped to pioneer the study of postmodernism within consumer culture. In this interview, Fuat F\i{}rat discusses his research projects including consumption patterns, postmodernity, theatre, new literacy and also presents more general observations.},

Funded simultaneously by religious organizations, philanthropic foundations, and corporate and governmental interests, early UNESCO educational films were particularly adept at utilizing diverse resources to bring diffuse networks of institutions and individuals together to produce films that promoted a specific form of participatory democracy and civil society. Via UNESCO's Communication Programme, these films served to advance not only UNESCO's humanitarian goals but also larger political and economic goals. By understanding the circulation and distribution of these productions, a clearer picture emerges of NGO- and state-sponsored visual information campaigns that utilized film to advocate for a particular form of neoliberal state building during the height of the Cold War.},

  abstract = {In midcentury America, the public opinion polling enterprise faced a crisis of legitimacy. Every major polling firm predicted a win for Thomas Dewey over Harry Truman in the 1948 presidential election\textemdash{}and of course they all got it wrong. This failure generated considerable criticisms of polling and pollsters were forced to defend their craft, the quantitative analysis of public sentiment. Pathways to Polling argues that early political pollsters, market researchers, and academic and government survey researchers were entrepreneurial figures who interacted through a broad network that was critical to the growth of public opinion enterprises. This network helped polling pioneers gain and maintain concrete, financial support to further their discrete operations. After the Truman-Dewey debacle, such links helped political polling survive when it could have just as easily been totally discredited. Amy Fried demonstrates how interactions between ideas, organizations, and institutions produced changes in the technological, political, and organizational paths of public opinion polling, notably affecting later developments and practice. Public opinion enterprises have changed a good deal, in the intervening half century, even as today's approaches have been deeply imprinted by these early efforts.},

@phdthesis{glander_education_1990,
  abstract = {This study examines the development of mass communications research as an area of study at United States universities during World War II and the Cold War. By mid-century mass communications researchers became recognized experts in describing the effects of the mass media on learning and other social behavior. This study analyzes the ideological and historical forces which gave rise to, and shaped, their research. The growth of the various technologies of mass communication in the early part of the twentieth century was a source of great concern, as well as a source of great optimism, among educators. Between World War I and World War II educators engaged in a wide ranging debate about the role of these mass media, centered largely around the issue of propaganda and its relationship to democracy and education. The dissertation presents an overview of this debate and argues that the debate subsided with the outbreak of World War II. The United States involvement in World War II required the creation of propaganda agencies whose primary goal was the development of techniques of mass persuasion. Scholars who went to work for these agencies sharpened their expertise in these areas, and made important personal contacts which facilitated the development of the field. Since the term "propaganda" had come to possess negative connotations, these researchers orchestrated a semantic shift away from "propaganda" to "mass communications." The field was enhanced by the large governmental research contracts which were awarded to university-based mass communications researchers during the Cold War. The work of several key figures in this research is discussed, including Berelson, Stanton, Hovland, Cantril, and Dodd. The work of Paul Lazarsfeld and Wilbur Schramm is reviewed, based on archival records. Lazarsfeld's early interest in this research is located in his adherence to socialism as a youth in Vienna. Schramm's interest in persuasion stems from his education in the neo-humanist tradition of Norman Foerster. The conclusion argues that ideological commitments of key researchers in the field, as well as other historical forces, had a major impact on the way in which these researchers came to view the mass media.},

@article{wasilewski_edward_2012,
  abstract = {Edward C. Stewart's work has been much affected by his own experiences and the historical spaces he and his families of origin have occupied. He remains one of the most complex members of the intercultural field. Although he played a key role in the initial organization of the field in the 1970s, he has also been the quintessential '' outsider.'' As a French-Swiss-Southern American-Brazilian, his multicultural perspective is novel. His initial academic formation was in experimental psychology with a focus on perception. During his whole career he has been creating comprehensive conceptual frameworks for the complex intercultural communication field of inquiry. One of Stewart's earliest pioneering efforts was at the 1974 conference held in Chicago to establish the intercultural field sponsored by the Speech Communication Association (SCA, now the National Communication Association, NCA), the International Communication Association (ICA) and the newly developing Society for Intercultural Education, Training and Research (SIETAR). At this conference Stewart's 40-page 1973 '' Outline of Intercultural Communication'' provided the '' text'' that the 200 participants, divided into small groups, discussed. Stewart began his work with a focus on cultural differences, using a contrast culture approach. This approach produced his two most famous works, the '' Contrast American'' or '' Contrast Culture Method (CCM) of Intercultural Training'' and his book, American Cultural Patterns: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Although this approach moves beyond simple contrasts to embrace similarities and the realization that differences are a matter of degree (Paige, 1993), later in his career Stewart focused more on adaptation, on dialectical, and contrasting forces. This all goes back to his original intellectual formation as a student of Harry Helson, the neurophysiologist, and Helson's idea that perception itself is an act of creation. This is the platform upon which Stewart constructed a cognitive/emotional/aesthetic dialectical geometry in which all '' liveliness'' includes seeming opposites AND the space between, the interface where relationships are formed. Stewart's most recent synthesis-in-process is a proposal to create a graduate level university course, '' Culture as the Central Social Science'' and an accompanying text, Forces of Identity (FORID) for Culture-Building. The idea is that this course would be a required course for any of the social sciences. Stewart's latest ideas (see part 6 Epilogue below) move way beyond a simple dialectical orientation to become a five-part (Seenko) framework for analyzing culture. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We examine Stewart's multicultural background and early formative experiences, especially his WWII experiences. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We examine the formative influence on Stewart's work of neuropsychologist Harry Helson's idea that perception itself is a creative act. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We identify Stewart's key contributions to the IC field, the Culture Contrast Method (CCM), American Cultural Patterns, etc. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We discuss his current syntheses-in-progress, a course, a textbook and a five-part framework for analyzing culture.},

However, the few moments in which he does reflect on popular music are highly revealing. In this article I provide a comprehensive overview and a critical analysis of Said's public statements on popular music, and argue that these strongly create dissonance with his interventions in postcolonial theory and politics. More specifically, I argue that in these reflections on popular music Said voices problematic elitist, orientalist, and universalist claims. Consequently, Said's notion of popular music constitutes perhaps the most antagonistic aspect of his oeuvre.},

Drawing on the work of Kunkel, Moreno, Lewin, and Korzybski, Murray focused on developing skills in interpersonal and group communication. He facilitated classroom activities that he believed would bring about positive change in students' personalities as well as enhance their relationships and leadership ability. Communication methodologies, he argued, could facilitate learning in all fields and foster interdisciplinary understanding. In spite of much skepticism by his colleagues, Murray introduced innovative classroom practices that advanced our thinking about instructional communication.},

  abstract = {The article presents an interview of Ernest Dichter, founder and president of Ernest Dichter Associates International Ltd. On asking Dichter, about his reason to get into the research field, he said that he came to the United states via Paris in 1938. His first job was in conventional market research, and what struck him, coming from clinical psychology and psychoanalytic research, was that people were being asked through questionnaires why they were buying milk, which happened to be one of the first things he worked on, and he just couldn't swallow that. It was almost comparable to asking people why they thought they were neurotic or to a physician asking a patient whatever disease he thought he had. Answering to a question as to what was his perspective and problems when he first entered the field, and how he sees the issues and problems today he said that, there have been some improvements but not enough to satisfy him. There are beautiful correlation coefficients being established which demonstrate that a particular group of people happen to be using this particular product more frequently. But then the jump is made that they are buying it because they are young, and that's where the problem arises.},

Following the heyday of moral panics, risk discourses and censorious policy-making that led to the European Commission's first Internet Action Plan 1999\textendash{}2002, EU Kids Online focused on conceptual clarification, evidence review and debunking of myths, thereby illustrating the value of systematic documentation and mapping, and grounding academic, public and policy-makers' understanding of 'the Internet' in children's lives. Consonant with Wellman's third age, which emphasizes analysis and contextualization, the EU Kids Online model of children's online risks and opportunities helps shift the agenda from how children engage with the Internet as a medium to how they engage with the world mediated by the Internet.},

  abstract = {Feminist film criticism is widely thought to have started in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the "Images of Woman" debate associated with critics such as Marjorie Rosen provided the foundation for later developments in feminist film theory. Antonia Lant has recently claimed the immediate post-1950 period to be a barren time for female-authored publications on film and cinema. This article argues that, contrary to received wisdom, the post-war period (1945-1959) in Britain was a time when women's film criticism flourished, with writers such as Dilys Powell, C.A. Lejeune, Catherine de la Roche and E. Arnot Robertson enjoying high-profile careers. Moving beyond a simple recovery of women's "hidden histories," this article highlights the points of connection between the post-war period and later film criticism informed by second wave feminism. Through a case study of de la Roche and Robertson this article explores how women critics in this period were similarly preoccupied with screen representations of women and women's roles within the film industry, anticipating the later concerns of Rosen and others. I argue that a cross-media focus is a productive method for generating insights into women's critical agency at this time, and conclude that women's film criticism demonstrates something of the wider shifts taking place in gender relations in British society.},

This article breaks away from the usual modes of parsing out research by disciplinary grounding, topic of investigation, or even school of thought, arguing that these older modes of mapping result in divisive academic speciation. Instead, the author proposes analyzing the similarities and differences in scholarship along three axes: methodology, ontology/epistemology, and axiology. This systemic mode produces a flexible and responsive way of viewing commonalities and tensions between scholars and approaches, suggesting productive combinations in which to flock together.},

First presenting short histories of each tradition's roots in the humanities and/or social sciences, the authors then proceed to build a typology of audience studies in terms of theories and modes of enquiry characterizing each tradition. While identifying some controversies arising from different theoretical and political orientations, the analysis also suggests that the current confluence of traditions could be useful for further theoretical, methodological and empirical developments. In particular, cross-cultural, multi-method research would seem to represent a promising avenue for further studies of the mass-media audience.},

It is argued that although a traditional field or disciplinary structure is not yet in place, the current interdisciplinary aggregations may have the makings of institutionalized academic units. Through comparison with the institutionalization of other interdisiciplinary areas of study (primarily that of communication and cultural studies), an argument is made for the need to create a firm intellectual foundation on which an Internet/studies can be built. Such a foundation should not only include sufficient and clear understanding of cognate fields but also include a foregrounding of power (as theoretical construct and practice) as a means of engaging the field in the world.},

Design/Methodology/Approach \textendash{} Advertising in a Free Society is placed in historical context (the Cold War), summarised and reviewed. Findings \textendash{} During the 1950s, as the UK experienced a period of affluence and growing consumerism, the advertising industry was again subject to the criticisms that had been levelled at it by influential scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Against this context, Advertising in a Free Society deserves to be remembered as one of the earliest defences of advertising and remains highly relevant. Harris and Seldon were leading figures in the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), joining shortly after its inception, which became an influential group both in the UK and abroad, influencing policy on free markets. Originality/Value \textendash{} Although Advertising in a Free Society attracted few citations (going out of print between its publication in 1959 and 2014 when it was republished by the IEA), and largely forgotten by marketing scholars, it provides a significant source for marketing historians interested in advertising criticism, the growth of the British advertising industry and the role of advertising in democratic societies. A reanalysis of the text situated in its historical context \textendash{} the height of the Cold War \textendash{} reveals that the text can be viewed as an artefact of the conflict, deploying the rhetoric of the period in defending the advertising industry and highlighting the positive role that advertising could make in free societies.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to review and summarize Pierre Martineau's Motivation in Advertising and to assess its status as a valid forgotten classic of the marketing literature. Design/methodology/approach Motivation in Advertising is reviewed and summarized, and its contributions to marketing and advertising history, thought and practice are assessed. Findings Martineau was among a handful of figures behind the '' motivation research'' movement among marketers and advertisers during the late 1940s to the 1960s. His '' new philosophy'' regarding communication theory, persuasion and advertising message strategy and tactics remains highly influential and relevant. Written during a period of tremendous growth in consumption in the USA and a revolution in the use of qualitative research in marketing and advertising, Martineau's book represents much more than a work about his experiences with motivation research, but a significant contribution to advertising communication theory as well. Originality/value Pierre Martineau was the subject of a historical biography (Martin, 1985), which also focused substantially on the principal themes and contributions of Motivation in Advertising. The book was also widely reviewed shortly after its publication. This more recent review and assessment, however, reveals the work's valuable historical insights into how postmodern consumption evolved and many present-day perspectives of consumer behavior and advertising effects coalesced during the Consumer Revolution and at the outset of modern advertising's '' Golden Age''.},

The first of these issues is examined in terms of the institutional history of communication. The various forces that contributed to a fragmentation of the discipline are discussed. Evidence that a clear disciplinary identity or '' self-concept'' is emerging in terms of a social science of communication is presented. This identity differentiates the emerging discipline from its various predecessors, including speech and journalism. While there is less evidence to be brought to bear on the second issue, what evidence there is indicates that respectability (and disciplinary maturity) is increasing, but that there is still much progress to be made.},

On asking about the state of advertising research in earlier days, he said that research was not as precise, not as sophisticated in techniques in those days. Moreover, it was not as easy to do the variety of cross tabulations that can be done today with computers and mechanized tabulating services. It was much slower in terms of development of reports, although I think most management people always wanted the answer the next day. In those days, one would give a timetable for a report that today you could not get away with at all. Answering to a question related to the problems and issues that are faced by researchers today, he said that, one of the problems that research faces today, and this was true earlier as well, is that the end use of the research is not necessarily thought of by the researcher. And there are other kinds of research. There's a research for its own sake, and that's very valuable. But in the applied research, sometimes the researcher gets carried away with methodology and loses track of some of the applications of the information.},

@article{burrowes_functionalism_1996,

Three criticisms proved decisive to this undoing; political conservatism; problems of logic, mainly tautology and an inappropriate appeal to teleological explanations; and a tendency to impose psychological and sociological analyses on specifically cultural materials. Formulated in reference to systemic Parsonian functionalism, which dominated the broader social sciences, these criticisms are relatively easy to reconcile within the contextual, actionist Mertonian tradition, which took root in the communications context, but only through a constructive dialogue with the cultural studies and cultural indicators approaches, both of which have spent the last decade investigating a traditionally functionalist concern - the hypothesis of cultural systems integration. If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology and cultural studies cautions a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies},

  abstract = {The late Marshall McLuhan's substitution of the term '' global theater'' for the more celebrated but arguably less effective '' global village,'' with its relational/holistic underpinnings, signals a turn in his media philosophy: from an ontology of identity supporting an organicist theory of mediated interplay (world\textendash{}self relations) to an ontology of difference, sense, and multiplicities prioritizing the existence of individual objects. The performative concept of '' global theater'' has been overlooked by media ecology commentators, who tend to interpret it as a colorful detail\textemdash{}a loose element in McLuhan's overall system\textemdash{}often associating it with a shift from detached contemplation to involved production. This essay argues that a mere shift from theory to praxis is not enough to fully comprehend this enigmatic concept, which holds one of the keys for understanding the late McLuhan's transition from an extended configuration, anchored in the constitutive subject, to a postfinite philosophy of difference, sense, and multiplicities akin to the '' new realist'' school of contemporary thought, particularly the '' fields-of-sense'' ontology of Markus Gabriel.},

For a researcher based in the sociology of scientific knowledge, being an Internet researcher has been a vivid opportunity to experience at firsthand a phenomenon usually studied from the outside. The article begins by assessing some models of the process of scientific change. Characterizing Internet research as new has been a potent resource for enrolling researchers into the field and positioning research responses. The development of virtual methods for doing social research illustrates the process of methodological innovation in social science and the negotiation of methodological adequacy. Methodological discussions have been enlivened by the advent of the Internet as an object of study. Internet research has arguably been a valuable reflexive opportunity for the traditional disciplines that have fed its development.},

The intellectual costs of this division are discussed, and possible means of furthering intellectual exchange between the two subdisciplines are discussed.},

  abstract = {The overall purpose of this article is to review theory and research on interpretive journalism, one of the key concepts in research on the style and character of news journalism. While it is often claimed that news journalism over recent decades has changed from being predominantly descriptive to becoming increasingly interpretive, our review suggests that there is a lack of systematic research in this area. The literature is furthermore characterized by different conceptualizations and operationalizations of interpretive journalism, as well as by different normative assumptions. Taken together, this suggests not only insufficient conceptual clarity, but also problems related to the comparability and cumulativity of findings. To remedy this, and based on our review of how interpretive journalism has been conceptualized and operationalized, this article suggests how interpretive journalism should be conceptualized and operationalized in order to increase conceptual clarity, comparability across studies, and ultimately research cumulativity.},

  abstract = {This dissertation focuses on Max Horkheimer's {$<$}italic{$>$}Institut f{\"u}r Sozialforschung{$<$}/italic{$>$} as a case study in the recent transatlantic history of ideas. By examining the encounters between German and U.S. thought during one of the most fruitful periods of cross-fertilization, this project charts the rise of our academic Atlantic culture, which has flourished in the wake of the Second World War. No doubt communication and information technology have provided the material basis for this development, but the face-to-face roots of this relationship extend back to the '' Intellectual Migration,'' when Germans and Americans struggled to learn from the intellectual and cultural differences that separated them. Settling in the United States in 1934, the members of the Horkheimer Circle charted an uncertain course from isolationism to assimilation and in the process became an intellectual phenomenon\textemdash{}the so-called '' Frankfurt School.'' While a great deal of research has been devoted to the intellectual and institutional history of the {$<$}italic{$>$}Institut f{\"u}r Sozialforschung {$<$}/italic{$>$}, relatively little attention has focused on the interactions that took place between members of the Horkheimer Circle and the communities of American scholars and readers that came in contact with them. My narrative concentrates on the main crossroads of transatlantic exchange in the Horkheimer Circle's history. Chapter one presents a summary of the history of the '' Frankfurt School,'' and offers an introduction to Critical Theory; chapter two explores the primary institutional relationship that dominated the exile experience of the {$<$}italic{$>$}Institut f{\"u}r Sozialforschung {$<$}/italic{$>$}, Columbia University; chapter three uncovers the web of inter-relationships and discussions about culture that arose between the Horkheimer Circle and the '' New York Intellectuals;'' chapter four explores the complex world of post-war sociology\textemdash{}the awkward disciplinary home of the '' Frankfurt School'' in exile; and the final portion of the dissertation, chapter 5, examines the complex relationship between the Horkheimer Circle and the American New Left\textemdash{}specifically, untangling Herbert Marcuse's connections to the student radicalism of the late 1960s and thus trying to distinguish between the myths and realities regarding Critical Theory at the high point of its U.S. reception.},

McCroskey's contributions to instructional communication can best be summarized by tracing his influence on what academics read in the scholarly journals, what they learned through his leadership roles with coauthorship collaborations and mentoring and within academic associations, and his research work shaping several areas within the discipline, particularly classroom excellence. One's legacy in part is determined by what one does and who one influences, but a scholar's legacy more profoundly is determined by how one's actions make a significant, undeniable impact on the trajectory of a discipline's constituents, research, and practices. This article identifies the major areas under the instructional communication umbrella that '' Jim'' developed, nurtured, and expanded through his research and his direct mentoring relationships and collaborations with others. The unique relationship each coauthor of this article had with McCroskey produces several distinct sections: Historical influences on his initial career, communication constructs and the learning model, his early work on person perception variables (ethos, attraction, homophily), communication and classroom influence (immediacy, power), traits and the communibiological model (communication apprehension, willingness to communicate, argumentativeness), methodological approaches, and disciplinary service and mentoring.},

Changing definitions of news in recent times, however, are likely to enhance the role of the social sciences in both professional journalism and journalism education, especially as some journalists seek to move beyond the reporting of specific, isolated events to providing a context which gives them meaning. If journalistic and social science methods are to become more closely wedded, one very important condition, in addition to interest by editors and availability of talent, is financial support from those who own and control mass media.},

They are offered at different levels from certificate to diploma to both undergraduates and postgraduates. Due to requirements of the media industry, there is a constant friction about the need to balance the academic and professional aspects in the curriculum. This has led to skepticism in the past about the relevance of formal journalism education. However, with globalization and growth of the media sector, there is an enhanced need for professionals. Many big media groups have launched journalism programs. Institutional and professional aspects of the programs in India and issues pertaining to curriculum, responses, and critique have been factored in this article.},

The paper provides a literature overview for showing that, and how, Marxian concepts have been used in Internet Studies. Internet Studies to a certain extent analyse the Internet, economy and society in Marxist-inspired studies terms, yet do not acknowledge the connection to Marx and thus seem superficial in their various approaches discussing capitalism, exploitation and domination. We argue that it is time to actively remember that Marx is the founding figure of Critical Studies and that Marxian analyses are crucial for understanding the contemporary role of the Internet and the media in society.},

R.) Leavis (1895\textendash{}1978). Who was Matthew Arnold? F. R. Leavis? What were the conditions of possibility of their work and words \textendash{} that is, for the practices and positions for which they advocated? What new questions might emerge by sharing in detailed and perhaps unexpected stories of individuals who, presently, seem to function in Cultural Studies mainly as known-unknowns? The argument is that the details of both Arnold and Leavis' lives are integral to understanding the conditions of possibility of their work, both individually and collectively, and indeed to more fully appreciating the meaning and implications their work holds for Cultural Studies. Apropos, this piece refines the methodology of keywords introduced by Raymond Williams [1958. Culture and society, 1780\textendash{}1950. New York, NY: Columbia University Press; 1983. Keywords : A vocabulary of culture and society. Rev. ed. New York, NY: Oxford University Press.].

@article{korzi_lapsed_2000,
  abstract = {With the rise of the democratic state came a strong emphasis on "the public" or "public opinion" in the study of politics. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of important works examined the contours of public opinion within a democracy. The study of public opinion since this early period has only intensified. However, recent work on public opinion is problematic: the theoretical and normative concerns and the political / sociological focus of the early works on public opinion are largely missing. Most modern studies of public opinion are psychologically driven and often truncated from broad concerns of American politics and democratic theory. In this article, I explicate the history of public opinion research, paying particular attention to the "early" works and how their concerns and emphases have been neglected by many "later" studies of public opinion. Through this history I aim to highlight the differences between the early and later phases and to suggest that much was lost in neglecting the concerns of the early writers on public opinion. While some contemporary researchers are, in fact, harking back to the early work, I conclude that a more thorough re-acquaintance with the classics of public opinion is necessary.},

  abstract = {Moving world-systems analysis into the cultural realm, Richard E. Lee locates the cultural studies movement within a broad historical and geopolitical framework. He illuminates how order and conflict have been reflected and negotiated in the sphere of knowledge production by situating the emergence of cultural studies at the intersection of post\textendash{}1945 international and British politics and a two-hundred-year history of conservative critical practice. Tracing British criticism from the period of the French Revolution through the 1960s, he describes how cultural studies in its infancy recombined the elite literary critical tradition with the First New Left's concerns for history and popular culture\textemdash{}just as the liberal consensus began to come apart. Lee tracks the intellectual project of cultural studies as it developed over three decades, beginning with its institutional foundation at the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS). He links work at the CCCS to the events of 1968 and explores cultural studies' engagement with theory in the debates on structuralism. He considers the shift within the discipline away from issues of working-class culture toward questions of identity politics in the fields of race and gender. He follows the expansion of the cultural studies project from Britain to Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. Contextualizing the development and spread of cultural studies within the longue dur{\'e}e structures of knowledge in the modern world-system, Lee assesses its past and future as an agent of political and social change.},

  abstract = {Despite his intellectual impact in the field of communication studies during the 1970s, Ludovico Silva is hardly remembered today even in his native country, Venezuela. Showing a singular intellectual honesty, Ludovico Silva worked on a general theory of ideology, challenging the official Marxism and leftist political forces of the age. Based on Marx\textasciiacute{}s difference between use value and exchange value, Silva argued that the Marxist category of surplus needed an equivalent in the symbolic realm; hence he developed the concept of ideological surplus in order to reject mechanical interpretations of ideology. Thus, Silva, among other scholars, contributed to Latin American communication studies by incorporating power and domination as structural forces in the making of social relations.

  abstract = {In a time in which an exuberant, trans-classical, non-trivial machine culture redesigns terminologies, remodels logics, produces new evidence, and reorganizes semantic resources, a new, neocybernetic regime of truth is taking shape. Many of our recent self-descriptions and theory formations are coined by our media-technological condition. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of Niklas Luhmann, especially in his inherent narrative of the history of rationality. This essay attempts to reconstruct Luhmann's redescription of European rationality, especially the media- and machine-historical conditions that remain apparent in Luhmann's account. The decisive issue is that Luhmann's history of rationality reveals the technological unconscious of systems theory and indeed the epochal imaginary it belongs to. With the help of the theories of machines developed by von Foerster, Simondon and G{\"u}nther, Luhmann's oeuvre must be read as probably the most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what could be called the 20th-century's epochal technological shift of meaning.},

George Gallup's polling techniques first achieved fame when he accurately predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would be reelected president in 1936. Gallup had devised an extremely effective sampling method that took households from all income brackets into account, and Hollywood studio executives quickly pounced on the value of Gallup's research. Soon he was gauging reactions to stars and scripts for RKO Pictures, David O. Selznick, and Walt Disney and taking the public's temperature on Orson Welles and Desi Arnaz, couples such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and films like Gone with the Wind, Dumbo, and Fantasia. Through interviews and extensive research, Susan Ohmer traces Gallup's groundbreaking intellectual and methodological developments, examining his comprehensive approach to market research from his early education in the advertising industry to his later work in Hollywood. The results of his opinion polls offer a fascinating glimpse at the class and gender differences of the time as well as popular sentiment toward social and political issues.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the abundance of Greek figures and scenarios in Kittler's recent work points to a shift in his oeuvre, which, however, does not represent a radical break with his 'hardware studies'. At the turn of the 21st century, Kittler champions an emphatic notion of culture as a necessary supplement to science and technology. This conceptual marriage mediates grand historical narratives of cultural identity. Specifically, Kittler's texts provide us with narratives of Greek origin which serve to re-capture collective identities in the age of globalization. On the explicit level, this identity is predominantly European, but the search has national components as well. With his turn to culture, the organizing trope of 19th-century German nationalism, Kittler has also embraced the legacy of German philhellenism, which articulated national identities through the theme of 'elective affinity'. Kittler's Greece occupies the very structural place it had in 19th-century German philhellenism: It stands in for both the foundation of European civilization and its virtual better self, a realm of sensual culture untainted by modern capitalism and Empire. Most of the figures inhabiting this realm are familiar from 19th-century discourse as well, but these discursive loops are fueled by contemporary feedback. Kittler's Greek narratives have developed out of postwar academic discourses and connect to other post-unification Greek fantasies.},

Statistical data can mislead, however, when numbers are reported without careful attention to the shifting classification schemes that underlie them. The work that is needed in order to understand the recent emergence of a communication discipline is at least as much theoretical and interpretive as it is empirical. To illustrate this point, we explore two types of indicators of growth and transformation of communication studies: statistics on degrees granted and trends in the classification of books and serials. For each type of indicator we show that the emergence of communication as a category has involved qualitative transformation of the category itself as well as quantitative growth within the category. This categorical transformation, and its deeper roots in the evolution of communication as a cultural practice, will be basic to any adequate interpretation of our discipline's increasing centrality in academe and in society.},

Both investigations were affiliated to the Princeton-Columbia workshop; both were connected with P. F.

The paper acquaints readers with the questions, methods and results of both investigations.

Answering to a question on the present condition of advertising research Ziesel said that, now research has spread enormously in many ways it has shifted from the agency and the media to the manufacturers. The agencies concentrate more and more on what is called creative research following the bifurcation that began with idea of separating the creative work from the bulk of administrative and mechanical work. He thinks research has followed it. The shift away from the agencies was facilitated by a perennial headache namely, the problem of billing research from the agency. Every so often the agency had to absorb these costs, so the development was really by mutual agreement, toward the manufacturer taking charge of his own research. On asking Ziesel about the legal side of his activities, Ziesel said that his work during the last 20 years at the University of Chicago Law School, was making lawyers aware that there is more to law than only study, constitutions, court decisions, and statutes.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, International Relations (IR) theorists are drawing inspiration from a broad range of theorists outside the discipline. One thinks of the introduction of Antonio Gramsci's writings to IR theorists by Robert Cox, for example, and the 'school' that has developed in its wake. Similarly, the works of Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, and Jurgen Habermas are all relatively familiar to most IR theorists not because of their writings on world politics per se, but because they were imported into the field by roving theorists. Many others of varying success could be cited as well. Such cross-disciplinary excursions are important because they inject vitality into a field that \textendash{} in the opinion of some at least\textemdash{}is in need of rejuvenation in the face of contemporary changes. In this paper, I elaborate on the work of the Canadian communications theorist Harold Innis, situating his work within contemporary IR theory while underlining his historicism, holism, and attention to time-space biases.},

  abstract = {What is metal studies? How can we define and characterize it? How has it emerged as a body of academic enquiry? What are its dominant disciplinary strands, theoretical concepts and preferred methodologies? Which studies have claimed most attention, defined the goals of scholarship, typical research strategies and values? How has the claim for the legitimacy or symbolic value of metal scholarship been achieved (if it has): over time and through gradual acceptance or through conflict and contestation? How can this process of formation, or strategy of legitimation, be mapped, examined and interrogated and which methods of historical, institutional and cultural analysis are best suited to this task? Working with the most complete bibliography to date of published research on heavy metal, music and culture (the MSBD), this article employs Foucault's archaeological "method" to examine the institutional, cultural and political contexts and conflicts that inform the genealogy of this scholarship. Such analysis reveals a formative, largely negative account of heavy metal to be found in the "sociology of rock"; a large volume of psychology work, examining heavy metal music preference as an indicator of youth risk, deviance and delinquency; sociological work on youth and deviancy critical of the values of this research and its links to social policy and politics; culminating in the work of Weinstein and Walser, who advocate a perspective sympathetic to the values of heavy metal fans themselves. Following Bourdieu, I interpret such symbolic strategies as claims for expertise within the academic field that are high or low in symbolic capital to the extent they can attain disciplinary autonomy. I then go on to examine the most recent strands of research, within cultural studies and ethnomusicology, concerned with the global metal music diaspora, and consider to what extent such work is constitutive of a coherent subfield of metal studies that can be distinguished from earlier work and what the implications of this might be.},

On asking Brenner, about his reason of getting into the field of advertising research he said that, it was the need to make a living. On asking about his definition of a good marketing person he said that, a guy that really knows how to utilize information to make a buck, and somehow to build a franchise or make products better. A marketing guy really is a guy who basically would like to have his own business and, all too often because circumstances are such, cannot have it. And it seems to him that the big contribution that marketing research people make is to be marketing guides to people who have marketing jobs. Answering to a question about his advise to a young person who was just entering the research field he said that the first thing the person should do is to go out and do door-to-door interviewing. Let somebody give him a practical problem and then go out and try to build his own questionnaire.},

Difficulties which the standard methods of empirical research incur in dealing with the concrete phenomena of popular culture may be avoided if a historical and philosophical frame of reference is used.

The first concerns 'transdisciplinarity', a new context for cultural studies, created by the 'cultural turn' in humanities and social sciences more generally. The second addresses the need to distinguish history as a discipline from a wider range of approaches that grasp the 'historicity' or 'temporality' of human life. The work of the hermeneutic philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, helps to identify this difference and engages with the double character of historical work: part empirical study, part 'fiction'. The article itself can be read as a narrative about history and cultural studies \textendash{} a story of debts and differences, polemics and splits, convergences and renewed dialogue. The article urges us to recognize the implications for historical cultural studies of moves towards 'culturality' in history.},

  abstract = {For a generation of political activists growing up in the 1930's opposing Fascism was a priority. The policy of appeasing Hitler and the non-partisan stance of the Labour Party in the face of the Spanish Civil War made the Communist Party an attractive alternative. From this generation emerged key figures in academia and publishing: Eric Hobsbawm, Ralph Miliband, John Saville, Martin Eve, Dorothy and Edward Thompson, and Raymond Williams. Woodhams studies the experiences of this generation, the motives which attracted them towards the CPGB, and their reactions to and experiences in the Second World War. He examines what opportunities were open to them in the post-war years and their influence particularly in the field of adult education. He argues that Raymond Williams anticipated some of the thinking of the new left, especially in the field of cultural studies. But in the shadow of the1956 events in Hungary another new left emerged drawing on post-war experiences and circumstances. This collective biography throws a new light on the continuities and breaks in British political and intellectual history. It challenges conventional periodization separating pre- and post-war history and questions the sources of continuity and change in Britain.},

These dual origins influenced the debate over journalism education from the mid-nineteenth century. News professionals and university educators pondered whether journalists needed to be college-educated, whether they needed a liberal arts degree, or whether they needed professional education that combined liberal arts and practical training. These debates were complex and political, representing issues of localism versus nationalism, the role of professional schools within the American university, and the rise of social science.

There, American communication studies well before the twentieth century drew to a close knew of its label, 'symbolic interactionism,' but its perspective and sensibility were largely forgotten, at least twice during the century. Duncan's thesis of communication and social order was not generally recognised for its sustained effort to bring the study of authority, hierarchy, and power into the centre of communicative interaction. A way to develop a communication theory of society, Duncan's work became a critique of communication research in the wake of the forgotten tradition he attempted to resurrect. The field had conceptually forsaken the idea of communication to disconnected concepts, for which Duncan equally faulted seminal European scholars who, nevertheless, offered the best explanations for the ordering of society until the arrival of symbolic interactionism and its cousin, philosophical pragmatism. This essay highlights Duncan's communication theory as a theory of society, and proposes a critical appropriation of this alternative in the history of ideas, one that warns of assumptions risked whenever communication is theorised without and with attention to power.},

This is partly due to the practical problems of working with newspapers (pre-digitisation); there has also been, however, a widespread perception that popular journalism is predictable, trivial and politically and socially conservative, and therefore not worthy of sustained scholarly attention. These attitudes are starting to change, encouraged by the process of digitisation. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of the press. This article is in two sections; the first examines how popular national newspapers have been used in political narratives, and the second explores their place in discussions of social and cultural change. The article argues that not only have entrenched stereotypes prevented historians from properly understanding the nature of popular newspapers, they have also led to them misinterpreting broader developments in British politics, society and culture.},

@phdthesis{redal_imaginative_1997,
  abstract = {Cultural studies has by now become largely institutionalized as an influential approach to theorizing and studying the mass media. However, most accounts of cultural studies' conflicted origins tend to be superficial or overly simplistic. This dissertation seeks to rectify that situation by offering an in-depth intellectual history of the early development of cultural studies as it evolved in Britain, with special attention to the significance of developments in cultural studies for media studies. The emphasis is upon the rise of cultural studies as a self-conscious political project heavily grounded in ideal modes of resistance. The study focuses on both the biographies and influences of cultural studies' main 'founders' and disseminators, including Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson and Stuart Hall, as well as the social, political and economic contexts within which their ideas took shape. The stress is upon the dialectic between conditions and consciousness in the formation of new ideas about culture. The study strives to explain, in empirical detail, how such ideas coalesced, diverged and spread. It examines influences upon cultural studies from Romanticism; literary criticism, especially the work of F.R. Leavis; the adult education movement; and the British New Left, stressing throughout the way in which the imagination is called to the fore in the struggle to resist the negative impacts of capitalist modernity. A detailed description of the founding of the Birmingham Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies is included, with special attention paid to the transition in the 1960s from 'socialist humanist' concerns to a more abstract theoretical orientation, exemplified initially in the embrace of structuralism and later post-structuralist theory. The thesis concludes with the argument that while cultural studies historically and appropriately seeks to offer a non-reductionist approach to culture, stressing the mutually determining matrix of relationships between the material and the ideal, much of its political potential as an intellectual project has been attenuated through too much neglect of actual material circumstances. If cultural studies is to realize its value for media research in particular, scholars in the field must strike a better balance between the study of the production, dissemination and reception of cultural products.},

  abstract = {Focusing on Kittler's reading of Goethe's `Wanderer's Nightsong' and Pink Floyd's `Brain Damage', the article traces Kittler's development from discourse analysis to media theory. Where more traditional approaches would stress notions of self-reflexivity (both the poem and the song elaborate on their effects and foreground their own construction), Kittler performs, in his own words, a kind of `implosion': The words of Goethe's poem collapse back into the discursive order they evoke, and Pink Floyd's song performs its own technology. But it is precisely this implosion that has an intoxicating effect, which paves the way for a more political, or at least politicized, reading of Kittler's work that highlights his indebtedness to the cultural transgressions of the 1960s.},

  abstract = {This article examines strands of an intellectual history in Media and Cultural Studies and Science and Technology Studies in both of which researchers were prompted to take up ethnography. Three historical phases of this process are identified. The move between phases was the result of particular displacements and contestations of perspective in the research procedures within each discipline. Thus concerns about appropriate contextualization led to the eventual embrace of anthropological ethnographic methods. The article traces the subsequent emergence of a 'crisis of context' in the deployment of ethnography within these disciplines. The analysis of these historical changes is informed by a particular depiction of Euro-American knowledge conventions. The article suggests that the limits currently perceived for ethnography are a specific instance of the more general limits now recognized for these knowledge conventions.},

  abstract = {This essay addresses recent misrepresentations of the study of political economy of the media. The discussion is grounded in some historical background, including a brief sketch of some of the history of critical communications research in the US, which flourished within the global profusion of critical research in the 1960s and 1970s. Part of this history is the emergence of organisational support for critical scholarship as well as the long-term employment of individual scholars by specific universities that made critical classes part of both graduate and undergraduate curricula. That process of institutionalisation provided the basis for the next generations of critical scholars from the 1980s through the present \textendash{} generations whose research address a broad range of communications phenomena, use a wide range of research methods, and draw from a wide array of critical theories. This overview sets the stage for a critique of the current attack on radical political economy specifically. That attack is considered in terms of two key texts that caricature political economic research as an enterprise dependent on theories imported from the Frankfurt School, limited to a macroscopic approach, only interested in journalism, and ignoring both media workers and media audiences.},

The literature moved to micro-level, interpretive studies that are often depoliticized and lack a critical approach to the subject matter.

  abstract = {In this article, I locate the institutionalization of Cultural Studies in the Departamento de Lenguajes y Estudios Socioculturales in the Universidad de Los Andes, Bogot{\'a}, Colombia. The conditions of possibility of the said institutionalization are ascribed to something like a crisis, itself engendered by the encroachment of neoliberal ideology on the University's sense of mission and understanding of itself. Essentially, a more or less traditional department of modern languages was abolished and a potentially innovative but epistemologically fuzzy department devoted to teaching language and the linguistic turn, each informed by the other, was cobbled together in its place. This required the re-tooling of the department's professors, but also the hiring of new professors who influenced the department's intellectual direction and contributed to the sharpening of the project. The article then describes how the incipient programme was the site of a struggle for epistemological clarity, which is here represented in the form of an argument about the necessity of thinking both Foucault and Marx together in the project of critical Cultural Studies.},

What defines communication's unique identity as a field is also what maintains its conceptual confusions. The field is compared to a nation-state. The essay places the field's emergence in the context of the history of the social sciences in order to help illuminate its current crises and to explore how we might find new ways of conceiving the field's intellectual task.},

  abstract = {After years of heated controversy over philosophical orientations among communication researchers, a consensus seems to have emerged that recognizes the value of both the American and Europeans traditions. It was in the wake of the 'ferment' debates among communication scholars in the late 1970s and early 1980s that African communication scholars also started to take stock of their field and take a closer look at their historical and cultural experiences. In trying to situate their own unique perspectives within the study of communication, these scholars lamented the paucity of authentic African theoretical perspectives. All human communication behaviour is grounded in culture. Hence, authentic African communication theories attempt to explain such behaviour from the African cultural context. Over the years, however, African communication researchers engaged more in 'reactive scholarship' than in original theory building and relied largely on Eurocentric theories to explain African realities. Our study seeks to assess what progress has been made towards theory building among African communication scholars, and to determine whether such efforts still remain largely 'reactive', consist-ing mainly of criticisms of Eurocentric models and theories. The data revealed that after 30 years of debate on the ferment in communication research, there is still a gaping hole in African communication research, one that is devoid of authentic African communication theories that reflect the cultural, linguis-tic and social cleavages of the African society.},

The reasons can partly be found in the support of biennial regional conferences, national research associations, and the Nordicom documentation centre. A similar relationship between interdisciplinarity and infrastructure can be studied at the single university performing research in this area. The case is the author's home base at the University of Oslo. Units and networks of media and communication research are analyzed as 'activity systems'. To what extent can the concepts of 'mediation' and 'knotworking' in 'activity theory' be useful in analyses of interdisciplinarity and infrastructure of media and communication research?

  abstract = {The article presents an interview of Alfred Politz, founder of Alfred Politz Research Inc. On asking about his reason of getting into research he said that, he thinks it was more or less accidental. He noticed that the most popular title for research was public opinion polling. It interested him, so he looked into some of the procedures and what he could learn about it. The first thing that stopped him was that the sample selection appeared to him to be rather naive. A so-called quota sample was used at this time, which was based on the assumption that if one stratifies his sample on a few known characteristics, then the unknown for which he makes the study automatically comes out right. Answering to a question as to what he would advise a person who wants to enter the research field professionally, he said that, he would suggest him to study some mathematical statistics and some experimental psychology, because experimental psychology still employed strictly scientific rules. Experimentation required rigid rules, whereas much of psychology was void of experimental need. Thus a psychologist could arrive at something as an opinion because it's his opinion without any further foundation.},

  abstract = {The article examines early problematizations of '' the audience'' in communication studies (in Michel Foucault's sense of problematization). Using Michael Hardt and Toni Negri's concept of the '' multitude,'' the author argues that the audience is a product of discursive constructions, but that these constructions themselves draw upon the ontological practices of what may be called '' audience powers'' or '' mediated multitudes.'' Problematizations of the audience in communication studies are examples of what Negri calls '' constituted power,'' as they seek to capture conceptually the immanent practices of audience constituent powers. Concentrating on 3 early audience discourses (propaganda, marketing, and moral panics), the author assesses how audience power provoked these problematizations and argues that an ontology of media subjects and audience powers offers new perspectives on audiences and audience studies},

  abstract = {This article describes a particular academic situation in which the authors organized a Cultural Studies programme in a specific place: the city of Rosario in Argentina. Our programme attempts to free itself from the curricular malaise provoked by the disconnect between the university and society and at the same time, it is the product of a paradoxical situation. Many who claim to do Cultural Studies rarely cross the borders of their own discipline, nor do they lend themselves to interdisciplinary dialogue. In the face of this, we proceed from the need to attend to the specific forms of contextualization in which knowledge is produced. We hew to a local logic in formulating the objectives of our programme. Still, this locality does not mean that we forget about global frameworks and transnational spaces and their determining effects. Rosario is a peripheral city whose identity is based not on being a central megalopolis (like Buenos Aires), but on regional and even transnational relations with other cities: Porto Alegre, Montevideo, Curitiba. This experience has led to the formulation of a cultural strategy notable for giving impulse to inclusive institutional forms and innovative cultural policies. We do Cultural Studies hoping to foment a critical look from our region, to contribute to the formation of agents that can act dynamically in our contemporaneity, not only to understand but to be involved in our social processes.},

Psychologists warn us of the dangers of "celebrity worship," sociologists interrogate young people about their personal expectations of fame, and even a discipline with as attenuated a relation to popular culture as literary studies now studies such things as ?post-colonial celebrity?. The textual richness of celebrity culture is proving irresistible, and so the fetish for textual analysis that dominated so much of the 1980s has found itself right at home in the study of celebrity. But is this what we want from the study of celebrity? What are the approaches that are most needed, and which are likely to be the most productive for those of us in cultural and media studies for whom celebrity has become part of the heartland for the study of popular culture? This article will discuss some of the options, and in particular it will ask how we might establish a stronger base for the study of the industrial production, as well as the audience consumption, of celebrity.},

While broadly deregulatory in intention, the Act gave the new media regulator, Ofcom, a duty to 'promote media literacy'. This article explores the origins of this theme, the different discourses and definitions in play, and the roles of the various agents involved. It argues that there were some significant strategic shifts in the debates around media literacy, which reflect broader tensions between neoliberal and social-democratic tendencies within New Labour's communications policy. The article suggests that this resulted in a lack of clarity about the definition of media literacy, the scope and nature of Ofcom's role, and the means by which the policy might be implemented \textendash{} problems that partly account for the subsequent demise (or significant redefinition) of media literacy as a theme within communications policy towards the end of the decade.},

Over the course of time, much has been written upon the topic, but no standardized analysis of the large body of academic literature has been conducted. This study employs a systematic approach to explore the current state of knowledge through journal analysis of public relations evaluation and measurement research. A total of 324 journal articles, published from 1975 to 2015 in 12 selected journals from the field of public relations and communication management, have been systematically reviewed. The review examines what has been researched in the past, how the research is interrelated, and what still needs to be investigated in the future. This paper reports on the major topical, theoretical, and methodological trends over time, and derives a research agenda, concerning above all the need for a holistic theory of value creating communication and more sophisticated measurement approaches.},

This article examines the benefits and shortcomings of such an approach and develops a set of methodological propositions, drawing on the principles and methods of the German tradition of Begriffsgeschichte (history of concepts). To demonstrate the usefulness of these propositions, the article briefly examines the ideas about audiences in socialist Yugoslavia, focusing on the surge of ideas about politically engaged audiences in the late 1960s. The concluding part of the article situates this historical episode in the wider geographical context and outlines possible avenues for a broader, transnational investigation of the history of ideas about audiences.},

A number of his key conceptualizations are critiqued including audience power, audience measurement, media content as a free lunch, audiences as a non-durable producer's good, the disappearance of labor power, and the revisionist history of capitalist development . At each point in the critique the contributions of various political economists who have revised and extended Smythe's work are highlighted.

In the article he outlines the difficulties and the solutions to obtaining reliable information about audiences in communist parts of Europe during that period and in the previous years before he was responsible. He shows how the internal political outlook and atmosphere at Bush House coloured the approaches that were taken. He shows how audience research for all the BBC's external broadcasting was developed from the early days and what was done after the Second World War when Soviet control over large areas of Central and Eastern Europe effectively closed many target area countries to any internal research. There was heavy reliance on anecdotal evidence, the few listeners' letters that were received and interviews with refugees leaving communist countries. But then new methods were developed, principally by the US government funded broadcasters, Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. They developed an extensive approach which contacted travellers from communist countries when they were travelling outside the communist areas and these produced a wealth of information about listening to western broadcasters. There was close cooperation between the audience research department at the BBC and the respective departments at RL and RFE. When the Berlin Wall came down and communist rule ended in all of Europe, research inside the country became possible. Some was actually possible and conducted even earlier in Poland and Yugoslavia. The surveys in country at the end of communism showed that earlier estimates based on interviewing travellers had been remarkably accurate.},

Despite the great and lasting attention paid to the seven propaganda devices, however, the story of this framework's origins has yet to be fully related.

Building on Marx's theory of alienation, the spectacle describes our passive, quasi-visual relation to the social world. The individual, divorced from the collective praxis that constructs our social world, is reduced to consuming corporate-supplied entrancing narratives. This article explicates and assesses Debord's theory. Its most serious defect is Debord's rejection of the necessary intermediation of social life by culture and communication. Furthermore, his analysis subscribes to the trope of mass society, which sees the populace as culturally denuded, divorced from community and subject to the imposition of false needs. Against this alienated world, Debord pits the ideal of a collective revolutionary subject that freely creates society. However, both terms \textendash{} alienated masses and revolutionary collective \textendash{} are implicitly dependent upon liberal individualism, which abstracts individuals from the cultural traditions and social relations in which they are embedded.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the mid-1960s saw a dramatic shift in how 'brainwashing' was popularly imagined, reflecting Anglo-American developments in the sciences of mind as well as shifts in mass media culture. The 1965 British film The Ipcress File (dir. Sidney J. Furie, starr. Michael Caine) provides a rich case for exploring these interconnections between mind control, mind science and media, as it exemplifies the era's innovations for depicting 'brainwashing' on screen: the film's protagonist is subjected to flashing lights and electronic music, pulsating to the 'rhythm of brainwaves'. This article describes the making of The Ipcress File's brainwashing sequence and shows how its quest for cinematic spectacle drew on developments in cybernetic science, multimedia design and modernist architecture (developments that were also influencing the 1960s psychedelic counter-culture). I argue that often interposed between the disparate endeavours of 1960s mind control, psychological science and media was a vision of the human mind as a 'cybernetic spectator': a subject who scrutinizes how media and other demands on her sensory perception can affect consciousness, and seeks to consciously participate in this mental conditioning and guide its effects.},

  abstract = {British cultural studies, represented perhaps chiefly by the so-called Birmingham School, is much marked by its strong orientation towards the application of grounded theory in the analysis of concrete cases, rather than the development of abstract Theory with a Capital T (in Stuart Hall's words). As a leading figure of the Birmingham School and a key representative of the active audience model in television studies, or broadly, media studies, David Morley stands at a point where this trend was set, as is evidenced in this interview. Questioned by Huimin Jin, Morley puts his audience studies into the contexts of British cultural studies, postmodernism, Marxism, social movements, and so on; and in doing so, he shows the ambiguity, and subtlety of his concepts of how to best theorize the active audience. Only by this method, Jin believes, could Morley launch his version of audience studies, which aims not to invent a general theory of media effects, but to use an interdisciplinary range of theories to explore how people actually respond to a TV programme; and only by this approach to audience studies, furthermore, could Morley develop a theory of the audience's activity, which is embedded in the course of their everyday life and that cannot be thoroughly colonized by discourses. Cultural studies, wherever it is conducted, therefore, Morley suggests, has to construct modes of analysis that are relevant to its own conditions of production in a particular place, at a particular time. This is the tradition, as we know it, but also the future, as Morley envisages, of cultural studies.},

  abstract = {This study was conducted to clarify the debate in the United States between the neo-Marxist and the reflective perspectives on the social role of modern mass advertising. It was set in the context of controversies which surfaced in 'Ferment in the Field' and 'Paradigm Dialogues' debates over various theoretical approaches in communication studies, including the debate over critical vs. empirical research. The study was designed to foster better understanding of the nature of the debate between the two perspectives on mass, national advertising as a first step toward possible resolution. Works by eight authors representing the two perspectives were examined. These authors included Stuart Ewen, Jules Henry, Michael Parenti, and Herbert I. Schiller for the neo-Marxist perspective and Ronald Berman, Stephen Fox, Roland Marchand, and Michael Schudson for the reflective perspective. The study compared and analyzed the agreement and disagreement between the two perspectives in six areas: (1) their interpretations of advertising; (2) their research concerns; (3) their theoretical assumptions; (4) the evidence they used to support their arguments or to arrive at their interpretations; (5) their research methods; and (6) the methods they used to verify their findings. The study concluded that, except for a few basic similarities, the two perspectives differed in most of the categories examined. These categories included the two perspectives' conceptions, assumptions, and arguments about the interrelationship between modern advertising (as a social institution, as a form of artistic expression, and as a marketing tool) and the rise of a consumer culture and mass consumption in the context of advanced capitalism or market economy. Except for detailed footnotes or endnotes and bibliographical data, no other standard, formal verification method or mechanism proposed or used by scholars from the two perspectives were found. The study concluded that no mutually agreed-upon criteria could be used to verify or refute the arguments put forth by the two perspectives. It was suggested that a genuine resolution of the debate between the two perspectives appeared to be remote.},

  abstract = {This study surveys current research, with an emphasis on European studies, of children and television advertising since 1994. This article briefly summarizes the report. Surveying the research on children and television, the author found that many different actors having economic and political stakes in the issue are active in the policy debate. Proponents as well as opponents of television advertising aimed at children have initiated and financed studies, the results of which often serve their respective interests. The fact that a majority of the studies on this subject have been steered by extra-scientific interests (e.g., the policy decision of whether advertising to young children should be banned or regulated) means that the studies have had different starting points and perspectives. Thus, it is found that those favoring television advertising aimed at children prefer to cite research based on observations, the results of which indicate that even very young children can recognize and comprehend commercial messages. On the other hand, opponents of such advertising tend to cite findings based on verbal responses that show that only after some years can children distinguish commercials from other program content and perceive their intent.},

The work includes studies of content, effects, and policy, and offers research conducted by social scientists and cultural studies scholars. The research questions represented here consider the content of programming, children's responses to television, regulation concerning children's television policies, issues of advertising, and concerns about sex and race stereotyping, often voicing concerns that children's entertainment be held to a higher standard. The volume also offers essays by scholars who have been seeking answers to some of the most critical questions addressed by this research. It represents the interdisciplinary nature of research on children and television, and draws on many academic traditions, including communication studies, psychology, sociology, education, economics, and medicine. The full bibliography is included on CD. Arguably the most comprehensive bibliography of research on children and television, this work illustrates the ongoing evolution of scholarship in this area, and establishes how it informs or changes public policy, as well as defining its role in shaping a future agenda. The volume will be a required resource for scholars, researchers, and policy makers concerned with issues of children and television, media policy, media literacy and education, and family studies.},

Many of the questions raised concerning this issue were similar to those asked later during the age of television. Relying heavily upon the psychoanalytic emphasis on emotion, catharsis, and intrapsychic dynamics, expert opinion voiced in various popular periodicals and newspapers of the day suggested that the violence and excitement portrayed in many of the crime and adventure programs was harmless, and perhaps beneficial, for most listeners. However, research in support of this conclusion was sparse, and psychologists evidenced little interest in the issue. Not until the advent of television, and the emergence of social learning theory in the early 1960s, did psychologists direct significant research effort towards evaluating the effects of media violence.},

It reviews the relevant theory on social movements, citizens groups, and interest groups from political science. Data are gathered on two dimensions of the research question: (1) We quantify the number of public interest advocacy groups focused on CIP in the United States from 1961 to the present, using organizational ecology methods. (2) We track the number of U.S. Congressional hearings held each year on CIP issues. The results show that CIP now exceeds other social movement issues (women, civil rights, the environment, human rights) as a major concern of Congressional activity, that the issues are becoming more interdependent, and that modes of citizens advocacy have undergone drastic changes in recent years.},

  abstract = {This article offers some self-reflexive comments on Communication and media studies in South Africa. The discipline in South Africa, presents a very exciting and intriguing posture for the simple fact that it allows for diversity\textendash{} observable in the variety of labels, emphases and curricula. Equally enviable is the currency of some aspects of the programmes offered in the country and the strong theoretical foundation of research publications. Yet some deficiencies observed in a number of the curricula provoke a call for standardization of programmes offered by the various universities. The lack of regulation could be held responsible for some lapses noticeable in the structure of the various programmes. Drawing on observations of South Africa's communication and media education landscape, this article argues that the field seems to be withdrawn and too inward-looking that is evidenced by the lack of interest in the affairs of the African Council for Communication Education (ACCE) and what used to be the predominantly locally oriented content of South African journals. Thus, South African academia is tactically excluded from the leadership which it should provide on the African continent. Some cross-references are made to the situation in Nigeria, being the country where the writer had been involved in communication and media scholarship before moving to South Africa.},

  abstract = {Communication has acquired many of the institutional-professional trappings of an academic discipline, but as an intellectual tradition it remains radically heterogeneous and largely derivative. What mainly explains the field's disciplinary emergence is its significant relationship to communication as a category of social practice, and it is, I argue, by reconstructing its intellectual traditions around that category that the field can best hope not only to become more intellectually coherent and productive but more useful to society as well. A theory of disciplinarity is presented in which every discipline derives its identity and coherence from its participation in the conversation of disciplines, for which it draws on a specific mixture of intellectual, institutional, and sociocultural discursive resources. Communication's specific character as a discipline thus can be understood in terms of its contributions to knowledge in certain intellectual traditions, its evolving institutional forms, and its relevance to '' communication'' understood as a socioculturally constituted category of problems and practices. The third of these factors \textemdash{} the sociocultural context of disciplinarity \textemdash{} has, I maintain, a primary role. Communication as a practical discipline has been constructed upon (even as it reflexively reconstructs) the foundation of communication as an increasingly central category in modern societies and global culture.},

At one time, the study of speech communication in this country largely focused on the development of one's voice toward an expanded appreciation of the '' noble pleasures'' of speaking. Through a series of epistemic transformations, the study of speech no longer directly concerns matters of oral performance and bodily gesture; instead, it has taken on the agenda of a social science discipline and has tended to de-emphasize the significance of the body in human communication systems, concentrating instead on language (langue) systems, ideologies, and communication technologies. The implication of the subdued role of the human body in the process of verbal performance provides the central problem for this essay\textemdash{}becoming thematic in the genealogy of speech communication studies (namely, the series of choices to elevate the discussion of speech communication subject matters over and above the experience and pleasure of the speaking subject). The essay concludes with reflections on the possibility of speech (understood as parole) as a human science\textemdash{}posited as '' communicology'' or a semiotic phenomenology of parole.},

  abstract = {This dissertation presents the philosophical debate about the growth of scientific knowledge and an analysis of the progress and degeneration of the scientific activity in the area of the uses and effects of mass communication. The first chapter of the dissertation surveys the history of the philosophical debate about the growth of scientific knowledge starting from the 1920's - 1930's with the logical-positivists, continuing with Kuhn's (1962) and Popper's (1963) analyses until Lakatos' (1970), The Methodology of Scientific Research Programs. This chapter concludes that Lakatos' Methodology incorporates Popper's criticism of logical-positivism and shows and supersedes the limitations faced by Popper's and Kuhn's works. The second chapter concludes that logical-positivism and Kuhn's (1962) model of scientific change are still very influential in the appraisal of mass communication research. Also, falsificationism is presented as a useful alternative to assess the scientific growth in this area as shown by the analysis of the Berelson-Schramm-Riesman-Bauer (1959) debate of the status of mass media research at the time. The third chapter presents the five research programs competing in the area of mass communication research. The fourth chapter gives a detailed account of uses and gratifications research in light of Lakatos' Methodology. The chapter specifies the progress and degeneration presented in uses and gratifications research. Later, the major theoretical and methodological problems facing the area and the attempts to solve them are mentioned. Finally, the present dissertation concludes that Lakatos' Methodology was successful in offering an alternative way to look at and evaluate the scientific works in the study of the uses and effects of the mass media and stresses the need to conduct more analyses of this kind to further assess the validity of Lakatos' (1970) model of scientific knowledge growth.},

Such a project is inherently political: how scholars narrate the histories of their fields reflect tacit assumptions about discursive boundaries and what counts for legitimate scholarship. Prominent historical narratives typically emphasize certain sub-fields and research traditions while giving short shrift to others. Suggesting larger erasures and deeper tensions in the history of the field, this article aims to recover one such neglected thread, embodied by a reformist policy scholar who is all but forgotten in communication research: Charles Siepmann.},

  abstract = {In 1946, after visiting Russia, Harold Innis remarked that the time had come to broaden the range of political economy by studying, first, the struggle for social supremacy between states, churches and commerce; and, second, the related competition between languages, religions, cultures and communications media. This, I argue, is what Innis accomplished. His early studies of Canadian economic history transcended conventional economics and laid the groundwork for a later political theory of communications. It expressly took up the 1946 challenge to address competing monopolies of knowledge and power, hence manipulating the space and time-binding properties of communications media. Innis' work reflected a materialist model of communications, a social ecology, a soft determinism or philosophic naturalism and it linked knowledge, freedom and power. Finally, I conclude, these insights permitted Innis to transcend bias and to search for a balanced culture.},

  abstract = {Building on an in-depth analysis of the core literature grappling with the philosophical problematization of communication, this article examines the oft-asserted interdisciplinary nature of communication studies by assessing some of its underlying presuppositions at the ontological and epistemological levels. The article evaluates the coherence of our fragmented discipline through the articulation of the categories of the One and the Multiple in ontological and epistemological directions. In doing so, the recurrent conception of communication studies as an interdiscipline is criticized while recognizing the importance of undertaking interdisciplinary research within the field. Are especially considered the historical roots of interdisciplinary advocacies, namely the institutional demands for interdisciplinarity that have often resulted in conceptions of communication studies by communication scholars themselves as a crossroads or a service discipline. Building from Ernst Cassirer's developments regarding the '' theory of the concept'', the author contends in the final section of the paper that the solution to the lack of coherence of the field lies in the necessity for communication studies to discipline themselves in order for the research undertaken within the field to acquire a common framework of intelligibility.},

  abstract = {Through surveying the literature on Mexican mass media published in American academic journals and books from 1945 to 1994, and the published literature in Mexico by Mexican researchers during the same period, this thesis assesses the influence of U.S. mass communication research ideologies and posits that Western scholars, mostly Americans, approach the study of Mexican mass media according to Western social, political, and cultural values. In general, traditional American social science methodologies, in particular, mass communication research, dominate Mexican mass media studies. Specifically, American scholars have tended to direct their analysis to the free expression of newspapers. This study found that most Americans in this field have limited themselves to judging the entirety of Mexican mass media from an American cultural viewpoint. In support of this conclusion, critical researchers have linked the problem of exporting 'alien' methods of study to Mexico and of bypassing or ignoring the social, cultural, and political realities of Mexico and other Latin American countries. This thesis shows how traditional American international media research conceives the Mexican media system from an American cultural perspective, thereby introducing a conceptualization of culture that implies the context of a free market of ideas in a free market economy. Still, based on a Cultural studies perspective, as posited by Stuart Hall and others, this study shows that by framing research questions based on Mexico's social, economic, and political realities (for instance, a dependent, capitalist society as opposed to an advanced, capitalist one), ethnocentric biases are avoided. The main question this thesis studies is: What approach have American scholars taken in their analysis of Mexican mass media? Findings of the research confirm the common complaint that the bulk of research carried out by American mass media scholars on Latin America has lacked sensitivity toward its cultural values, political systems, and economic conditions. Similarly, this study found that much of the media research in Mexico carried out by Mexican scholars followed lines of inquiry, theories, and methodologies proposed by Western researchers. Finally, this research shows that lack of indigenous research accounts for the theoretical dependency of Mexican scholarly works.},

  abstract = {How is it that American intellectuals, who had for 150 years worried about the deleterious effects of affluence, more recently began to emphasize pleasure, playfulness, and symbolic exchange as the essence of a vibrant consumer culture? The New York intellectuals of the 1930s rejected any serious or analytical discussion, let alone appreciation, of popular culture, which they viewed as morally questionable. Beginning in the 1950s, however, new perspectives emerged outside and within the United States that challenged this dominant thinking. Consuming Pleasures reveals how a group of writers shifted attention from condemnation to critical appreciation, critiqued cultural hierarchies and moralistic approaches, and explored the symbolic processes by which individuals and groups communicate. Historian Daniel Horowitz traces the emergence of these new perspectives through a series of intellectual biographies. With writers and readers from the United States at the center, the story begins in Western Europe in the early 1950s and ends in the early 1970s, when American intellectuals increasingly appreciated the rich inventiveness of popular culture. Drawing on sources both familiar and newly discovered, this transnational intellectual history plays familiar works off each other in fresh ways. Among those whose work is featured are J{\"u}rgen Habermas, Roland Barthes, Umberto Eco, Walter Benjamin, C. L. R. James, David Riesman and Marshall McLuhan, Richard Hoggart, members of London's Independent Group, Stuart Hall, Paddy Whannel, Tom Wolfe, Herbert Gans, Susan Sontag, Reyner Banham, and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.},

During this time its critical perspective was complex and contradictory, with the Journal continuing to hold out hope for the eventual improvement of superhero comics. However, the Journal focused most of its critical energies on what were known at the time as groundlevel comics, small, independently published comics that utilised the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror and superheroes. The Journal largely ignored alternative comics until the late 1980s, and it wasn't until the 1990s that the Journal fully embraced them as the driving force for the evolution and improvement of American comics.},

  abstract = {In this intellectual history of British cultural Marxism, Dennis Dworkin explores one of the most influential bodies of contemporary thought. Tracing its development from beginnings in postwar Britain, through its various transformations in the 1960s and 1970s, to the emergence of British cultural studies at Birmingham, and up to the advent of Thatcherism, Dworkin shows this history to reflect a coherent intellectual tradition, one that represents an implicit and explicit theoretical effort to resolve the crisis of the postwar British Left. Limited to neither a single discipline nor a particular intellectual figure, this book comprehensively views British cultural Marxism in terms of the dialogue between historians and the originators of cultural studies and in its relationship to the new left and feminist movements. From the contributions of Eric Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, Sheila Rowbotham, Rodney Hilton, Catherine Hall, and E. P. Thompson to those of Perry Anderson, Barbara Taylor, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, and Dick Hebdidge, Dworkin examines the debates over issues of culture and society, structure and agency, experience and ideology, and theory and practice. The rise, demise, and reorganization of journals such as The Reasoner, The New Reasoner, Universities and Left Review, New Left Review, Past and Present are also part of the history told in this volume. In every instance, the focus of Dworkin's attention is the intellectual work seen in its political context. Capturing the excitement and commitment that more than one generation of historians, literary critics, art historians, philosophers, and cultural theorists have felt about an unorthodox and critical tradition ofMarxist theory, Cultural Marxism in Postwar Britain will appeal to students and scholars of cultural studies as well as those interested in the broader terrain of Marxist theory and contemporary critical theory.},

@article{frey_cultural_2010,
  abstract = {The heyday of classical film theory is predominantly understood to have been concerned with ontological and formal matters and with promoting film as an art. Pursuing the shapes and contours of the new medium, many writers on cinema from the 1920s heralded cinema as a 'universal language'. Examining the 'universal language' thesis, one finds a remarkable variety to the various arguments. By undertaking a close prospect of just one version of the 'universal language' thesis by a single writer, B{\'e}la Bal{\'a}zs, this essay intends to complicate the enterprise of 1920s 'classical film theory'. Tracing back the messy trail of reception and production and returning to the heart of Bal{\'a}zs's output, one finds a universal language which is neither truly universal, nor technically a language. Bal{\'a}zs's writings on cinema and language form the basis of a Janus-faced philosophy caught between future and past, film theory and human history, between an anthropology of the person and a prescription for various peoples. Re-examining Bal{\'a}zs and interrogating the 'universal language thesis' draws attention to the various modes, functions and addressees of what is called 'classical film theory' and to the need for new historiographical paradigms which take material matters of production and reception into account. At the same time, Bal{\'a}zs serves as an example for what unites many of the 1920s classical film theorists: the tension between the universal and the nationally specific and between their proposed theories and implied histories of film.},

In this essay, the work of two prominent communication and media studies scholars, Joshua Meyrowitz and James Carey, is examined in order to demonstrate how their studies represent media ecology with rigorous and insightful analyses of the dynamic interaction between communication, consciousness, and culture. Perhaps more importantly, this essay highlights how the works of these two media ecologists fit into and embody a North American cultural studies approach to media studies. The intent of this essay is to push the understanding of the intellectual roots of media ecology toward a broader analysis of how media ecology is embedded in, and advocates for, the larger move in communication studies away from narrow, quantitative effects research and towards qualitative and interdisciplinary scholarship that is North American cultural studies.},

With a full-blown academic legitimation crisis well under way, cultural studies resonated strongly with social struggles that shaped both its reception as well as its capacity to augment new intellectual academic formations. Retrieving the historical nexus questions views that treat and limit British cultural studies to being mainly an intellectual import-export phenomenon. The overlooked historical nexus fosters trivialization anad caricature of cultural studies' incorporation in the American academia, resulting in both conservative antipathy and left disappointments feeding into the common binary narratives of the 'failure' of cultural studies for being too Marxist and not Marxist enough. Restoring the historical nexus underscores the value of cultural formations and projects Williams proposed, while cautioning theoreticist and methodological enclosures.},

  abstract = {This paper will focus on an applied research initiative we are currently engaged in, which brings together academics (both from conventional institutions \textendash{} the university, the research centers and undergraduate colleges \textendash{} and from 'new and innovative institutional structures') with policy-makers and grant-making organizations. The initiative has to do with the entire field of higher education (India having one of the biggest higher education systems in the world), but interestingly it was incubated by the Center for the Study of Culture and Society (CSCS). The painstaking process of the gestation of collaborative interdisciplinary themes/fields of research/teaching and the labor of negotiation with policy-makers and grantees in the field of higher education by a Cultural Studies centre is thus the focus of this paper. Called the Higher Education Cell, an important aspect of the initiative's genealogy is that it is based on (a) a critique of the existing disciplines and an attention to the birthing of 'new thematic/field specifics' as also (b) a critique of the research undertaken in mainstream institutions and an attention to new research methodologies. The Higher Education Cell is at present focusing on four major functions through which it plans to engage with the higher education sector. These functions are (i) Incubation of Research Initiatives, (ii) Institutional Collaborations, (iii) Documentation and Archiving, and (iv) Grant Development. The research initiatives, which include Globalization and Higher Education, General Education in Comparative Perspective, Regional Language Resources, and Social Justice in Higher Education, have been conceived through collaborations with a range of higher education institutions. The wider context of the labor of negotiation is one where (1) new institutional structures are being experimented with, resulting in the emergence of 'institutions with a difference', (2) new interdisciplinary courseware or new themes/fields of research/teaching are being created (such as film-media studies, gender-sexuality-Dalit studies, migration studies, environment studies) and (3) new research and pedagogic methodologies are being given shape.},

  abstract = {This article presents an always risky cartography of the institutionalization of the field of Cultural Studies in Colombia in the 1990s. The article starts with a personal narration on how the author was introduced to this novel field by entering the first graduate programme in Cultural Studies in Colombia. Here, it locates the major tensions, stereotypes and loud silences characteristic of the social sciences in Colombia in which this institutionalization was infused and also threatened by the 1990s. But far from thinking that this recent event inaugurated an intellectual project thanks to the importation of theories and methodologies at this moment, the article describes previous intellectual traditions like the one influenced by the works of Orlando Fals Borda that had challenged positivist and neutral intellectual approaches to major problems in Colombia. Also, it highlights the influence that the work of Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero had through his paramount work on media and mediation since the 1970s. Afterwards, the article succinctly contextualizes the institutionalization of Cultural Studies in the 1990s through the emergence of the Ministry of Culture and the multicultural mantra and a whole scholarly and state's concern for cultural industries and culture policies. Finally, it describes the ?perverse confluences? between these new events and the arrival of neoliberal policies that had radically changed and challenged Colombian public and private universities. The article concludes with a contrasting image between a multiplication of interests, programmes, departments, conferences and publications in Cultural Studies in the larger universities in Colombia and their rampant transformation through the new scripts of audit cultures, indexation and the whole quantification of knowledge production.},

It refers, however,only to the German reception of cultural studies and focuses on the different ways cultural studies have become influential in various contexts since the 1970s. Three major stages can, roughly, be detected. The first comes from a new Leftist background dealing with working class and youth culture, and the discussion of the notion 'ideology'. The second grew out of the youth culture debate in an attempt to re-politicize it, elaborated by the so-called 'German Pop left'. The third is now within academia, particularly in media studies and'Kulturwissenschaften'. The contribution aims to sketch out the limitations of the, however different, lines of the German reception of cultural studies as well as the weaknesses of the attempts to work in cultural studies with reference to what can be called the German (intellectual) tradition.},

  abstract = {The name Cultural Studies and its institutionalization in the university must not allow us to lose sight of the fact that reflection on culture is an old tradition, especially in a society like Peru's, so heterogeneous, conflictive and charged with history. The very fact of the convergence or clash of cultures in the sixteenth century fomented the consciousness that cultural uses and customs are not natural but must be understood in the light of history. Since the seventeenth century we have essays attempting to objectivize cultures and their (mis)understandings. These constitute a tradition of trying to imagine a viable society out of fragmentation. Garcilaso de la Vega and Huam{\'a}n Poma are the founders of this desire to comprehend the other and propose just ways of living together. In the nineteenth century this reflection deepens, since now the task is to constitute a nation. Many will think that homogenization around the creole identity is the path towards modernity. Others will feel that the past lives on and gives form to the present, necessarily complex and plural. This debate about the country takes place in literature and in cultural criticism, in the works of Mari{\'a}tegui, Arguedas, Vargas Llosa, Flores Galindo. This tradition is taken up by Cultural Studies which, as an academic activity is born of the dialogue between the humanities and the social sciences. It is a dialogue in which psychoanalysis functions to facilitate the encounter. This article emphasizes the immediate antecedents of the institutionalization of Cultural Studies and situates them within the framework of a necessary public intervention which characterizes this type of interdisciplinarity.},

Specifically geared towards an Anglophone readership, the paper relates the re-emergence of cultural techniques (a concept first employed in the 19th century in an agricultural context) to the changing intellectual constellation of postwar Germany. More specifically, it traces how the concept evolved from \textendash{} and reacted against \textendash{} so-called German media theory, a decidedly anti-hermeneutic and anti-humanist current of thought frequently associated with the work of Friedrich Kittler. Post-hermeneutic rather than anti-hermeneutic in its outlook, the reconceptualization of cultural techniques aims at presenting them as chains of operations that link humans, things, media and even animals. To investigate cultural techniques is to shift the analytic gaze from ontological distinctions to the ontic operations that gave rise to the former in the first place. As Siegert points out, this shift recalls certain concurrent developments within the North American posthumanities; the paper therefore also includes a discussion of the similarities and differences between German and North American posthumanism.},

I argue that media sociology has been at its most vibrant when its goal has been to understand the dominant cultural structures that shape the public sphere. Robert Park was the first sociologist to adopt this perspective, with his research on newspapers and the power of the press. This interest continued into the 1950s, with research on media and propaganda. By the 1960s, however, concern had shifted away from the public character of media, focusing instead on the ways in which social factors intervened between media messages and society. While important, this shift in analytical focus ultimately led to a more reductionist media sociology, which failed to explore how media provided a distinctive type of social output. There is evidence that a less reductionist media sociology has begun to emerge since the 1990s, with the rise of cultural sociology and theories of the public sphere. This new media sociology could increase its visibility within mainstream sociology by making more explicit connections to the Chicago School tradition, and by claiming Robert Park as its classical founder.},

Mills's own published writings, along with those of his biographers, encourage a view of his time at the bureau as an aberration. Yet, a careful examination of his letters and his work reveals that the critical position for which Mills is famous was actually nourished by his use of surveys, statistics, research teams, and other trappings of administrative research while at the bureau.

Drawing on the very characteristics ascribed to early cultural studies work, the article illustrates that various moments at various other locations, from the Folk Schools of Denmark in the 1920s to Highlander School in North America's Appalachia in the 1930s to the Kamiriithu project in Kenya in the 1970s could and should be identified as 'other' origins of cultural studies. The aim in generating a multiplicity of origins is not to suggest that the Birmingham origin is 'false' but to underscore the point that cultural studies has multiple origins rather than a singular origin; to provide concrete examples of those other origins that are too seldom suggested and almost never pinpointed; and, most importantly, to contribute to the evolution of a more international cultural studies as well as to keeping cultural studies in progressive, anti-disciplinary flux.},

The reactions were swift, and authors like Schramm, Riesman and Bauer replied to Berelson's text defending the vitality of the field of Communication and disqualifying his diagnosis. Today, however, it could be useful to reconsider Berelson's sentence in order to understand what particular field was vanishing. The death sentence pronounced by Berelson, beyond expressing the state of the field of Communication in the 50s, reveals some fundamental questions about Communication research in general; Questions that many have assumed to be resolved but which may be more relevant today than ever.},

As this article demonstrates, these assumptions continue to operate in the literature today. In updating the normative orientations that inform political communication research, the analysis focuses on certain research agendas as exemplar efforts of a changed philosophical position, called neoconservatism, which undergirds and structures studies critical of press performance. In particular, we critically examine 3 research programs in political communication that adhere to the field's formative intellectual assumptions as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis. Suggestions are made for a fuller integration of communication perspectives into political communication research as well as new ways of thinking about media in relation to politics.},

Although some successful and influential attempts of empirical and social research were made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the tradition of regular research was not established before World War II. Until the late 1950s, empirical social sciences did not exist in the Soviet Union. Instead of research, society was described by using ideological construction of the Communist Party history. Attitudes toward sociology started to change in the middle of the 1960s. Empirical sociological research expanded into many areas of study and began to spread across the country. Sociology deserved official recognition and was very popular in society; sociologists enjoyed both official and popular prestige. This article examines the development of both sociological and media research in Estonia, starting with the 1960s.},

Because of that, our reasons for disciplinizing?to the extent that it is possible to choose to become a discipline?would be largely strategic. Given that the field is already successfully reproducing itself, the symbolic benefits of becoming a discipline are relatively limited, and such a move would also have significant intellectual costs.},

How effective are such campaigns in changing health-related attitudes and behaviors, however, and how has the literature in this area progressed over the past decade? The purpose of the current article is threefold. First, I discuss the importance of health mass media campaigns and raise the question of whether they are capable of effectively impacting public health. Second, I review the literature and discuss what we have learned about the effectiveness of campaigns over the past 10 years. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of possible avenues for the health campaign literature over the next 10 years. The overriding conclusion is the following: The literature is beginning to amass evidence that targeted, well-executed health mass media campaigns can have small-to-moderate effects not only on health knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, but on behaviors as well, which can translate into major public health impact given the wide reach of mass media. Such impact can only be achieved, however, if principles of effective campaign design are carefully followed.},

He is perhaps best known for the '' Navajo Film Project'' that he conducted with anthropologist John Adair in which they gave 16mm cameras to Navajo residents of the Pine Springs, Arizona reservation in order to explore how people who had never made or used movies would do so for the first time. How would their movies reflect their own culture and their ways of seeing and telling about their experiences? The book, Through Navajo Eyes, included here, became enormously influential in the fields of anthropology, communication and cinema studies, among others. In The Complete Sol Worth, editors Larry Gross and Jay Ruby collect all of Sol Worth's published writings, as well as some unpublished writings, extensive photo essays, and articles about Worth's work. Sol Worth's work remains relevant and influential in visual communication and anthropology, and the e-book format enables an accessible collection of the entirety of his contributions.

Answering to the question on the issues and problems that confronted him when he first entered the research field Nielsen said that, the most serious problem involved the raising of the necessary capital. He had always feared failure due to inadequate capital, and to make sure that this would not be the fate of the new Nielsen Company, he made careful estimates of the amount required and then raised three times that amount.

On asking Nielsen, about his unique contribution in the field he said that, there were several, and they did not all occur at the start. The first was the performance surveys. They were very useful to nearly every client who subscribed to this service. However, it was difficult to persuade the typical client to purchase a sufficient variety of these surveys to enable his salesmen to use them successfully with any type of prospect for his product and so that he could pile proof on proof to an extent which achieved conviction on the part of the prospect.},

He was born in Vienna, Austria and was interested in empirical research because he was trained as a mathematician and partly because empirical social research was of considerable political interest in that time of a rapidly rising Labor party in Austria. He states that in Austria, doing empirical research on the situation of the working class was of very great political importance because it clarified the importance of social stratification. In empirical research, he asserts that one has to distinguish between university organizations, university institutes and the increasing number of commercial research organizations. He claims that the structural elements of a good research bureau have two educational advantages. First, the relation between the project director and his assistant is much more intimate than between a graduate assistant and his graduate student. Second, it forces a much greater clarification of elements involved in research. He claims that there is a simple distinction between the department and the bureau. A full professor cannot tell an assistant professor or even an instructor what to do, that guarantees a famous academic freedom. In a bureau, the director hands to certain staff members certain tasks.},

It deals with the historical development of the relationship of media, culture, society, and the public. It traces the development of different notions of culture, their impacts on the media, and their relationships to various conceptions of ``the public''. It draws on this history to explore current debates about the influences of the media and society on public life. In the first part, the paper deals with some issues of the relation between theories of communication and theories of society. It grounds the study of the media and communication in the classical social theory and in the context of liberal pragmatism (Chicago School). It tries to answer the questions such as how Dewey, Lippman, Mead, et al. conceptualize the media and communications and what theoretical assumptions underlie liberal pragmatism. Further, it seeks to explore the differences between Mass Communication research (Media Effects Tradition) and Critical Theory (the Frankfurt School). The main question in this section is how the ideas of thinkers associated with the ``critical'' tradition compare with those of the ``liberal'' and ``media effects'' traditions. The article also focuses on the differences between British Cultural Studies and the American version of cultural studies. Lastly, it reviews the debate in Feminist and Audience approaches to the media.},

Ten years is only a moment in the span of social research, but aeons in Internet time. Has social research across the disciplines been up to the challenges? Over more than 40 years, the unfolding development of the Internet and related information and communication technologies has been one of the most dynamic areas of technological and social innovation worldwide. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, its development was even more dramatic. While innovations in such areas as search, social media, big data, and the commercialization of the Internet became prominent only over the last decade, they are already taken for granted by most Internet users. It is becoming increasingly apparent to us that this interdisciplinary field must broaden even further to better connect with fields beyond the social sciences and information, communication, media and cultural studies to include stronger collaborative ties to law, ethics, and the sciences, engineering, and computer sciences, but also across the arts and humanities. This will be an almost certain requirement for interdisciplinary research over the coming decade with technology and society moving at Internet time.},

This article reviews the past 10 years of this research, describing the relationship between the health topics addressed in the research, the shifting focus of concerns about the media, and, ultimately, the variation in problems for health promotion. I suggest that research attending to topics related to bodily health challenges focused on whether popular media accurately or appropriately represented health challenges. The implication was that there is some consensus about more right or wrong, complete or incomplete ways of representing an issue; the problem was that the media are generally wrong. Alternatively, research addressing topics related to sociocultural context issues focused on how certain interests are privileged in the media. The implication was that competing groups are making claims on the system, but the problem was that popular media marginalizes certain interests. In short, popular media is not likely to facilitate understandings helpful to individuals coping with health challenges and is likely to perpetuate social and political power differentials with regard to health-related issues. I conclude by offering some possibilities for future health media content research.},

As a result, studies often either examine all 3 approaches in a single study or employ very similar research designs, paying little attention to conceptual differences or differences in the levels of analysis under which each approach is operating. In this article, I revisit agenda-setting, priming, and framing as distinctively different approaches to effects of political communication. Specifically, I argue against more recent attempts to subsume all 3 approaches under the broad concept of agenda-setting and for a more careful explication of the concepts and of their theoretical premises and roots in social psychology and political psychology. Consequently, it calls for a reformulation of relevant research questions and a systematic categorization of research on agenda-setting, priming, and framing. An analytic model is developed that should serve as a guideline for future research in these areas.},

  abstract = {This article reviews the various research institutions that Paul Lazarsfeld founded, and the work done there by himself and by his colleagues. Special emphasis is put on the Columbia Bureau of Applied Social Research. Starting with radio research, the Bureau later shifted its interest to personal influence studies. In the methodological realm, panel studies, snowball sampling, mathematical modeling, and many more contributed to the progress of social science. The Bureau's work under the guidance of Lazarsfeld is shown to have grown from an interplay of methodological or theoretical needs, of funds, of concrete subjects for study, and finally of findings that in turn create new methodological or theoretical needs. The article concludes by reviewing what might have become of the Columbia Bureau had circumstances been different.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes Paul Lazarsfeld's 1941 book, Radio and the Printed Page, arguing for the book's enduring significance in communication and media studies. In the book, Lazarsfeld rejected the then-influential technological determinist model that Hadley Cantril and Gordon Allport had developed through studying the new medium of radio. In contrast to Cantril and Allport, Lazarsfeld found through studying Americans' listening and reading habits that radio's effects on society were not totalizing, and he discovered that radio not only did not diminish the importance of reading printed texts, but that it in fact may have encouraged the practice. The book established Lazarsfeld's scholarly reputation in the United States and formed the basis for his later and widely influential research. Long ignored in the intellectual history of media studies, Radio and the Printed Page is in fact a foundational work, one that contains the clear beginnings of the social constructivist ideas that Lazarsfeld would later articulate in The People's Choice and Personal Influence. Ultimately, the work presented a theory understanding media effects as significant but not totalizing, analyzed how people made meaning of media content through everyday social life, and demonstrated the continuing relevance of print in a world increasingly linked together by newer forms of media.

The claims reviewers made for the influence of interpersonal communication relative to the mass media, especially in the political process, went even beyond those advanced by the authors. They overlooked not only the very restricted conceptualization of '' effects'' that guided the Decatur research but also previously accumulated evidence on multiple kinds of media influence. This article argues that the new conventional wisdom pitting personal versus mass media effects associated with this and previous studies in the Columbia tradition discouraged, however inadvertently, a coming generation of sociologists from researching the effects\textemdash{}particularly long-range effects\textemdash{}of mass communication. As a consequence, academic sociology came to cede much of the high ground it once occupied in media studies to political science and to more professionally oriented departments or schools of communication.},

They were not adversaries in a great public debate about the fate of the public in modern democracies in the 1920s. Rather, their exchange about the '' phantom'' public was reframed as a conflict in the early 1980s, a reframing which has achieved broad interdisciplinary acceptance even though its rests on a casual rhetorical trope, not historical documentation. The reframing provides a salutary but inaccurate origin story for American media and cultural studies, illustrates the hazards of relying on secondary interpretations of historical sources, and deflects attention away from realistic assessment of the problems confronting democracy today. Dismantling this disciplinary folklore is essential to the integrity of the emerging '' new history'' of media and communication.},

  abstract = {President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's private polling served as a historic turning point in American politics. Roosevelt, faced with a constricting party apparatus and hostile relations with the media and Congress, sought to strengthen the executive branch in order to achieve a measure of independence from the Democratic Party, the media, or Congress. Polls, we argue, allowed Roosevelt and subsequent presidents to gauge public opinion without the consent of parties, the media, or Congress. Emil Hurja's polls for the DNC and Hadley Cantril's polling for Roosevelt explain this new function of the presidency. Emil Hurja disseminated poll data to the president, employing statistical techniques that began to obviate the local Democratic party as an institutional conduit between the electorate and the executive branch. Hadley Cantril was more than a poll data disseminator; he was also a media and communications advisor. Roosevelt's advisors used private polls as vehicles to advance the president's legislative and public relations agendas, and as instruments to measure the popularity of policies not yet codified and candidates not yet announced. Thanks to these polls, Roosevelt had a secret weapon that loosened the bonds previously preventing the executive branch from becoming the leadership vehicle he envisioned it to be. Of the ways in which the executive branch began to grow under Roosevelt, the assimilation of public opinion polls and the advice that accompanied them as an accepted function of the presidency signaled a historic change in the evolution of American politics.},

This article argues that this marginalization is, in part, the by-product of long-standing disciplinary debates over the inadequate political development of the American public. To develop this argument, the article first surveys the work of early political scientists, such as John Burgess and Woodrow Wilson, to show that their reformist ambitions largely precluded discussion of mundane activities of social life such as popular culture. It then turns to Harold Lasswell, who produced some of the first investigations of popular culture in American political science. Ironically, however, his work \textendash{} and the work of those who adapted similar ways of speaking about popular culture after him \textendash{} only reinforced skepticisms concerning the American public. It has thus helped keep the topic on the margins of disciplinary discourse.},

As we discussed topics ranging from masturbation to sexual ethics, many described their continuing struggle to reconcile their desires with deeply held moral beliefs and political convictions. This essay recounts various events from the Wheelock conference and draws on the published work of prominent male feminists such as John Stoltenberg, Robert Jensen, and Sut Jhally. I argue that, by failing to adequately account for the pleasures of objectification, the radical feminist analysis of pornography faces a dual risk: remaining marginal and irrelevant, and/or being absorbed by the much larger Christian anti-pornography movement.},

  abstract = {This article discusses the overall situation of cultural studies in Portugal. It starts by analysing some of the courses and graduate programmes currently on offer. The results suggest that cultural studies is experiencing a fast academic expansion. While this seems to be entangled with top-down institutional changes, in the wake of the Bologna process and the turn to the cultural/ creative industries and as part of a more general shift to the `new economy', there are reasons to believe that al-ternative understandings of cultural studies have not died out. The name `cultural studies' continues to cause unease in some academic quarters (namely, in literary studies) and there is ambiguity regarding what is meant by it. Cautioning against the tendency to reduce Portuguese cultural studies to a straightforward import from the Anglophone world, I argue for the need to conduct historically informed research on local strands and traditions of cultural theory and critique. I conclude that only a combined synchronic and diachronic approach \textendash{} one that is sensitive to national and transnational contexts and intersections \textendash{} will allow us to gain a bet-ter understanding of the deep-running contradictions that characterise the field, helping us to clarify the stakes and reconnect to a socially relevant and critique-orientated intellectual project.},

Each of these books has played a challenging role in shaping my own approaches to teaching (and learning), first as a secondary school teacher and later as a college faculty member. As I see it, the importance of privileging human beings over our technological tools and authentic learning transactions among teachers and students over mediated information transfer is a central theme that Postman continued to explore throughout his life as a thinker, author, and teacher.},

It is first argued that most authors fail to distinguish between 'frame' and 'framing' and therewith produce a conceptual confusion and imprecision that is not conducive to the field. Second, it is argued that current frame and framing research ignore sociological research about news production and news audiences that reached its zenith in the 1980s and is still conceptually and methodologically relevant to much current frame and framing research. As a result, a notion of power is absent from most current frame and framing research. By discussing \textemdash{} on the basis of key literature \textemdash{} what a news 'frame' is, how it comes about and how it is of consequence successively, these claims are substantiated and research directions for improving the field are indicated.},

It would perhaps be a risky, ridiculous, and disingenuous enterprise to position Adorno as either an enthusiast or a fan. Rather, being an '' uncompromisingly critical thinker'' (kompromi\textbackslash{}s slos kritisch Denkende) is Adorno's preferred approach to philosophizing culture. Yet Hellings argues that Adorno's conceptualization of being uncompromising unintentionally supports an amorous subject and comportment, which is not altogether dissimilar to being an enthusiastic fan. This article, therefore, reads Adorno's philosophy of culture against the grain, and it does so by focusing on a constellation of concepts: fan, fanatic, fanaticism, Schw{\"a}rmerei, Begeisterung, playfulness, and love. The article attempts to salvage a notion of critical fandom in and against Adorno: to give serious and uncompromising participants of (popular) culture a chance. This attempted rescue is intended to allow for a more extensive reconsideration of the relations between philosophy and fandom.},

The book, Through Navajo Eyes, included here, became enormously influential in the fields of anthropology, communication and cinema studies, among others. In The Complete Sol Worth, editors Larry Gross and Jay Ruby collect all of Sol Worth's published writings, as well as some unpublished writings, extensive photo essays, and articles about Worth's work. Sol Worth's work remains relevant and influential in visual communication and anthropology, and the e-book format enables an accessible collection of the entirety of his contributions.

In addition, we sought to determine the most prolific scholars in a subset of journals considered to be most central to our discipline. Results indicated that 30 individuals could be considered prolific scholars for the years spanning 2007?2011 for the list of 24 journals, and six individuals could be considered prolific in the central journals. It took nine and eight articles within the five-year period to make each list, respectively. We also report the top 25 most prolific and active researchers since 1915. Results are discussed as they pertain to trends in the discipline.},

The communications industry has countered that propaganda merely circulates socially useful information in an efficient manner and further, that propaganda is harmless to democracy because of competition and professional codes. This study critically examines these various schools of thought in an effort to determine and understand the contribution and effects of propaganda in a democratic society.},

In both countries, communication scientists conducted their research with its benefits for propaganda practitioners and waging the Cold War in mind. It has been suggested that after an initial period of close cooperation between politics and communication science, early expectations of the potential of systematic research for controlling the hearts and minds of people through propaganda started to fade.

  abstract = {During the 1920s and 1930s, a critical framework for analysis of social influence, called propaganda analysis, gained sway in American social science. The epistemic rationale of the paradigm was its ability to explain the phenomenon of modern mass persuasion. The paradigm's ideological appeal came through its ability to widen citizen participation in society and its match with postwar disillusionment and Depression-era skepticism. By the late 1930s, the epistemic germ of propaganda analysis was weakened by the growing tendency to equate science with statistical and experimental methods; and its ideological roots were withered by attacks on social critics and demands for academe to aid in national mobilization. Critical propaganda studies were displaced by a rival paradigm, called communication research, the latter able to render useful and politically noncontroversial wartime and postwar service to government and private grantors.},

The origin of radio psychology, however, is the late 1920's, when radio began to air many promoters of psychology in the context of '' public service'' programming. Among these individuals were Louis Monash, Arthur Payne, and, perhaps most importantly, Joseph Jastrow. Traditionally-trained psychologists used the new medium of radio in the service of education and adjustment. This article surveys radio psychology, its personalities, and topics in the inter-war period and proposes the significant social support role that radio psychology played during the Great Depression, much as modern talk radio does today (Ricks 1984).},

  abstract = {The advent of scientific public opinion polling gave democratic governance a new dimension. For the first time representatives could discern people's opinions on virtually any public issue. Despite this ability, three important questions remain. Are people adequately informed to consider the complex problems of modern government? Will they give their true opinions to a pollster? And even if these two conditions are satisfied, do representatives have to be bound by popular opinion? This article argues that modern public opinion analysts who use polling data tend to ignore these questions and instead focus on patterns of attitudes among various groups in the population. Before scientific polling became common, those who studied public opinion directed their efforts to the connection between behavioral manifestations of public opinion and the development of public policy. They worried more about the role of public opinion in the formulation of public policy. It turns out that much of the public opinion literature preceding scientific polling remains relevant, and we ignore it at our peril.},

Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilises Australian-held primary and official industry association material to present a more detailed and revisionist history of PR education in Australia in its foundation decades. Findings - This paper, which locates Australia's first public relations education initiatives in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide in the 1960s, contests the only published account of PR education history by Potts (1976). The orthodox account, which has been repeated uncritically by later writers, overlooks earlier initiatives, such as the Melbourne-based Public Relations Institute of Australia, whose persistence resulted in Australia's first PR course at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in 1964. So too, educational initiatives in Adelaide and Sydney pre-date the traditional historiography. Originality/value - A detailed literature review suggests this paper represents the only journal-length piece on the history of public relations education in Australia. It is also the first examination of relationships between industry, professional institutes, and educational authorities.},

This article therefore presents an overview of his notion of communication and asks: How does Raymond Williams conceive of communication? How can we use his communicative materialism today for understanding digital communication? Williams advanced a materialist understanding of communication. His elements of a materialist communication theory help us to illuminate communication in the context of the base/superstructure problem, and ideology as a peculiar form of instrumental communication. He provides concepts that we need for a materialist understanding of digital media. The article concludes that we need the approach of communicative materialism for grounding a Marxist theory of communication that is relevant to the analysis of digital media.

The goal of the comparison between what the author calls the 'television revolution' \textendash{} a period in which film theorists became aware of the impact of television on the study of cinema \textendash{} and the now well-known 'digital revolution' is to observe the recurrence of specific phenomena in the history of film studies in France. The author argues that during both the television and digital revolutions there appears to be a desire to compare cinema with other media while at the same time asserting its specificity. The impact of the television and digital revolutions on film studies in France is thus two-fold: (1) the broadening of the discipline's boundaries to include other media and other research methods; and (2) the redefinition of cinema based on a singular definition of the medium.},

All of the ideas from the periphery were underestimated, if not considered ideological or political disputes and, consequently, non-scientific. Despite this lack of recognition, the Latin American legacy to communication for development and social change constitutes one of the main theoretical frameworks for building a more complex, participatory and democratic communication paradigm. Some of the first proposals of Latin American communication scholars in the 1970s and 1980s shared similar ethical/political aims. These involved a grassroots and critical basis and, above all, a constant a constant attention to praxis as the core of a new way of thinking, researching and planning communication.},

Especially important were the rapid innovations in survey research methods developed by two prominent research centers at Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This article argues that the Columbia and Michigan voter studies presented two visions for research on democracy. Where the Michigan research produced quantitative measures expressing the 'political behavior' of the electorate, the Columbia studies, and especially Paul F. Lazarsfeld, presented an alternative vision for qualitative research on political choice. Largely ignored by later voter studies, this vision prefigured much contemporary research on democracy that embraces a qualitative or interpretive approach. This article reconstructs Lazarsfeld's alternative vision, describes the institutional context in which scholars disregarded it in favor of formal quantitative models, and argues for its recognition as a forerunner to qualitative research on democratic processes.},

Second, I argue that the recent reinvention of Lippmann holds the potential to reanimate Carey's articulation of communication and cultural studies. For, as I demonstrate, Lippmann helps us rethink the articulation of expertise, democracy, and communication.},

Three types of information are needed: (1) on the sociohistorical setting in which the field emerged, (2) on the founders who conceptualized it in different universities (French and English), and (3) on the theoretical emphases of the field.

  abstract = {Models in communications studies from the 1940s and 1950s depicted mass communication as one-way traffic. Sender and recipient faced each other almost like two individuals, yet unknown to each other, sharing a stream of messages that carried unequivocal contents with detectable consequences. From this meagre beginning, many modifications were added and new theories developed in the ensuing six to seven decades. In the process, 'senders' have become complex organisations embedded in the power system of society, 'messages' have become a part of culture more generally and 'the audience' is situ- ated within multiple cultural and social contexts. Models have become more interactive, but have they changed enough? Perhaps there is still a need for a review of the state of the art: of what we really know about personal and social communications and the white spaces on our maps.},

It attracted leading professionals and scholars to its fellowship, technology, and media research programs. The result was a distinctive interaction between media industries and the academy that produced many major books, studies, and other intellectual products including a journal that informed the media-society relationship. A joint venture of a university and a media foundation with special links to journalism education and media industries in the United States and internationally, the program decamped from Columbia in 1996 and was phased out two years later.},

To substantiate this claim, the paper debunks the book's claim to social scientific objectivity by pinpointing the methodological shortcomings of the empathy model and of the Middle East project from which the model was derived, and highlights the paradigm's dogma by revealing the religious metaphors with which the book's narrative is infused.},

Building on an innovative approach that moves beyond a systematic literature review, this article contributes to our understanding of scholarship concerning digital communication technologies and how they may have been adopted and shaped protest movements and political engagement. Based on visualizations, we draw a sociotechnical timeline of protest and media technology scholarship within three dimensions: technological development, methods and techniques, and the social phenomena under investigation. The article concludes by identifying major trends in protest and media technologies scholarship over the past 15 years. The sociotechnical timeline enhances our understanding of academic discourse at the intersection of protest and media technologies by highlighting shortcomings and potential for future research.},

The traumas of World War II, the Holocaust, the failure of reason to prevent war and genocide, the threat of thermonuclear war, the limitations of the Enlightenment, logical positivism, the analytic philosophical tradition, and the reduction of rhetoric to the elements of style as envisioned by Ramus, moved Hannah Arendt, Michael Polyani, Kenneth Burke, Stephen Toulmin, Cha{\"i}m Perelman, and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, and others, to recover and renew rhetoric.},

Many applications have the potential to make major contributions in meeting the needs of an unhealthy and aging population. Key questions confronting health communication research reflect long-standing concerns about effects of new technology on health knowledge, health behavior, health delivery, and health outcomes. A review of the literature provides useful insights about how technology has been used to communicate health messages and their associated outcomes. Focus is placed on effective health communication, lessons learned, and implications for the future. During the next 10 years, the application of new technologies in health communication will be enriched by a tradition that has evolved to reflect a more dynamic connection between health users and providers. Future applications have the potential to provide cost-effective communications tailored to large numbers of individuals and achieve positive health outcomes. Consequently, we should strive to answer research questions about tailoring communication content, the channel used to deliver the message, and evaluation models that are best suited for examining outcomes of multicomponent tailored, technology-based communication.},

This present study analyzes and compares communication research on China in 14 top-ranked journals over the past 20 years. Our analysis reveals patterns, trends, and gaps in communication research on China during this period. The results indicate that China has received more scholarly attention with publication numbers increasing from 4 articles in 1995 to 13 articles in 2014. China is the most-researched East Asian country. Its research article numbers are twice that of the second-most-researched country, South Korea. China's political system was the most-used rationale in the research articles. More China-focused studies used a critical/interpretative approach and fewer used mixed approaches compared to research on other Asian countries. As a first-of-its-kind study, our findings offer needed guidance for future research on Chinese communication.},

His teaching, especially at the University of New Mexico and the Summer Institute for Intercultural Communication, has introduced thousands of students to the field, and many of today's leading practitioners were directly and personally influenced by Condon's approach.

The study improves on Edeani's work by analyzing a wider and more recent spectrum of articles regardless of topic, publication, or geographical region and by using updated parameters derived from contemporary studies. Results indicate that Africa-focused scholarship is in an emergent mode and developing robustly. Africa-focused scholars uniquely focus on newspaper rather than television content, and case study is the favorite method of inquiry. Confluence with research in other regions includes the preponderance of atheoretical approaches, the use of qualitative research methods, and the use of nonempirical approaches. Pertinent implications are discussed.},

Different conceptions of the history of mass communication research are related to different ideological, theoretical, and methodological commitments. The essay demonstrates that how one articulates the history of mass communication research has significant implications for how one understands and studies the media.},

Our research relies on several of Radv{\'a}nyi's publications archived in different countries, as well as on interviews with family, acquaintances, and experts on the work of his wife, the German poet Anna Seghers. During his years in Mexico, Radv{\'a}nyi founded the Scientific Institute of Mexican Public Opinion, in 1941, and the International Journal of Opinion and Attitude Research, in 1947\textemdash{}a forefather of today's IJPOR. He was also a founding member of WAPOR. His early '' sample surveys'' raised important methodological issues and recorded opinion results that reflect the vibrant times of war and policy making in a modernizing country. However, Radv{\'a}nyi's contribution to the profession has been virtually forgotten. Until now, accounts about how public opinion research began in Mexico either ignored Radv{\'a}nyi's works or reduced his ten years of survey research to a single footnote. This article is an attempt to fill this enormous omission and highlight some of Radv{\'a}nyi's contributions to these early stages of survey research.},

  abstract = {Scholars exploring the 'problem' of propaganda and democracy, or the history of propaganda and warfare, or the history of American mass communications research, consistently have marked World War I as the point at which the 'idea of propaganda' emerged in the modern era. Historians note that democratic governments had never relied so heavily on elaborate propaganda campaigns as part of their 'total war' ammunition; and never before, it seems, had the democratic citizenry been so manipulated. From the end of the World War I through World War II, a generation of American social critics, political theorists, and government officials were acutely aware that propaganda was ubiquitous, powerful, and a potentially highly destabilizing weapon of political warfare. My study explores the relationship between three important political and intellectual tendencies in mid-twentieth century America: Elite concerns about the rise of 'mass society' and its purported threat to democracy; the growth of American social sciences and the emergence of communications research as a response to the challenges of mass society; and the growth of centralized state power, particularly the state's expanding capacity for marginalizing and controlling political dissent. My dissertation is not a study of the production or dissemination of propaganda, or of different psychological warfare campaigns. Rather, I am concerned with fears about propaganda and how those fears shaped social critics' political assumptions, social scientists' analytical techniques, and government lawyers' frameworks for the purposes of mobilizing for war and creating and enforcing an administrative and prosecutory propaganda 'prophylaxis.' My research and analysis combines traditional concerns of political history with the strategies of intellectual history and the insights of the new cultural studies to explore the contradictions and tensions at the heart of twentieth-century liberal thought and action.},

  abstract = {The main memory of American mass communication research holds that scholars around Paul F. Lazarsfeld, in the years during and after World War II, dispelled the conventional wisdom that media marinate the defenseless American mind. According to the story, a loose and undisciplined body of pre-war thought had concluded naively that media are powerful\textemdash{}a myth punctured by the rigorous studies of Lazarsfeld and others, which showed time and again that media impact is in fact limited. This storyline, first narrated in Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's Personal Influence (1955), remains textbook boilerplate and literature review dogma fifty years later. The dissertation traces the emergence of this '' powerful-to-limited effects'' disciplinary legend, with special emphasis on the surprising contributions of sociologist Edward Shils, the mandarin theorist and intellectual maverick with little interest in the empirical study of media. In the crucial postwar years, Shils provided an account of the disappearance and reemergence of '' small group'' research, which he framed as a contrast between pictures of society\textemdash{}between the mistaken European view of impersonal isolation as against his view, that Gemeinschaft elements endure. Shils's treatment of small-group research, and especially his embedding of that story in terms of societal imagery, was essential to the field's mnemonic emplotment. Shils had his own intellectual reasons for narrating the history in the manner that he did\textemdash{}reasons rooted in his evolving and deeply engaged search for the underpinnings of modern social order. In a sense, however, his reasons did not matter once the narrative itself was released to the American sociological public; Lazarsfeld and Katz had their own reasons for adopting the historical picture that Shils put forward\textemdash{}reasons largely centered on scholarly competition and norms of originality. The powerful-to-limited-effects narrative in Personal Influence, in turn, was so widely embraced in the late 1950s for a still-different set of reasons\textemdash{}because of the scholarly support it lent to the public intellectual defense of American popular culture, in the context of an evolving Cold War liberalism. The staying power of this limited-effects narrative was ultimately guaranteed, however, by the newly institutionalized, would-be discipline of '' communication''\textemdash{}which retained the storyline as a usable, and teachable, past.},

  abstract = {The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by statute in 1972. This action built on a long history in this country of interest in examining the wider societal implications of science and technology. More specifically, it followed a decade of work by (what are now called) the Science Committee of the House of Representatives and the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate with the help of the private academic and industrial sectors, in particular the National Academy of Sciences. During the ensuing 23 years, under the guidance of an equally bipartisan congressional Board, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} evolved a structure and a process which provided analysis, information, and options to Congress and a reputation for nonpartisan, accurate and complete reporting. Importantly, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} also provided, through the intense use as advisers of experts and stakeholders from the nongovernmental sector, an open interface between many American communities and Congress. The description of the justification, history, structure, and procedures of \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} affords a perspective on the abrupt abolishment of the agency in the first session of the 104th Congress. A number of explanatory factors rather than a single one were likely responsible for OTA's elimination and are noted. The implications of abolishing \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} are also discussed.},

  abstract = {In The Citizen Audience, Richard Butsch explores the cultural and political history of audiences in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present. He demonstrates that, while attitudes toward audiences have shifted over time, Americans have always judged audiences against standards of good citizenship. From descriptions of tightly packed crowds in early American theaters to the contemporary reports of distant, anonymous Internet audiences, Butsch examines how audiences were represented in contemporary discourse. He explores a broad range of sources on theater, movies, propaganda, advertising, broadcast journalism, and much more. Butsch discovers that audiences were characterized according to three recurrent motifs: as crowds and as isolated individuals in a mass, both of which were considered bad, and as publics which were considered ideal audiences. These images were based on and reinforced class and other social hierarchies. At times though, subordinate groups challenged their negative characterization in these images, and countered with their own interpretations. A remarkable work of cultural criticism and media history, this book is essential reading for anyone seeking an historical understanding of how audiences, media and entertainment function in the American cultural and political imagination.},

Specifically, the discussion groups disciplinary histories into 2 different kinds of narratives, referred to as biographical and intellectual histories. The first group has as its method biography, and focuses on the achievement of central individuals and the methodology of their research. It is argued that these accounts constitute rituals of disciplinary affirmation. The second group has as its method intellectual history, and focuses on the theoretical foundations of ideas taken up by communication scholars, tracing the relations among ideology, culture, technology, and communication. These accounts, on the other hand, are read as polite rebellions against received understandings of communication history.},

This introductory essay illustrates the needs for such a volume to fill an important gap in IC history, provides a rationale for focusing on the 1970s, and discusses the current state of documenting various expressions of the intercultural discipline. It highlights the value of biography as one historical window from which to review or reconstruct the social history derived from the interdisciplinary influences and outcomes of IC or related intercultural fields. After a brief review of earlier people and tracks that influenced the field's eventual formation, it provides categorical and chronological summaries of people and their initiatives in and around the 1970s that established IC, the rationale that guided inclusions or omissions for this '' selected'' set of biographies, and highlights other worthy influencers not profiled. This essay provides an overview for the questions that contributing authors were asked to address about each person featured in this special issue: (1) the ways they founded, influenced, or affected the ongoing IC field or related intercultural work, (2) the topics or domains that they influenced, (3) the lines or types of IC they launched and outcomes of their legacies, and (4) the principles, practices, or personal characteristics those in the field now can reconsider as catalysts for renewal or future developments.},

In Refiguring Mass Communication, Peter Simonson compares his own vision of mass communication with distinct views articulated throughout history by Paul of Tarsus, Walt Whitman, Charles Horton Cooley, David Sarnoff, and Robert K. Merton, utilizing a collection of texts and tenets from a variety of time periods and perspectives. Drawing on textual and archival research as well as access to Merton's personal papers, Simonson broadly reconceives a sense of communication theory and what social processes might be considered species of mass communication. Simonson reveals the geographical and social contexts from which these visions have emerged and the religious and moral horizons against which they have taken shape. In a unique perspective, he considers the American county fair as an example of a live gathering and crucial site that is overlooked in contemporary forms of mass communication, urging a reconsideration of how individuals participate in and shape similar forms.},

  abstract = {Purpose The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the author's decade-long tenure as the Editor of the European Journal of Marketing (EJM). The paper presents his thoughts on the past 10 years of marketing scholarship, his views on future directions and some advice for those looking to publish their research in academic journals. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a reflective, discursive approach, and also reviews a wide range of topics relevant to marketing researchers. Findings The author finds that EJM has grown substantially on many levels in the past decade. He also finds that there are some concerns around marketing research, and social scientific scholarship in general, that marketing scholars may wish to consider and take into account in their ongoing work. Research limitations/implications The paper is partly a personal view, and does not rely on any empirical research. However, the views espoused are justified by theoretical review and conceptual argument. Practical implications The implications of this paper are relevant to marketing scholars, journal reviewers, readers of research, as well as those who manage scholarship (e.g. university administrators). The author suggests a number of directions that the research, publication and reward process could move in to improve practice. Originality/value The paper brings together a large number of different views and concepts relevant to further development of marketing research, and provides original summaries and extensions.},

An important new development in cultural studies in Japan is Cultural Typhoon. This new movement seeks to avoid institutionalization and create an alternative academic public sphere alongside broadened cultural practices, social activities and political interventions. Cultural studies in Japan can be seen as a part of a new diversity in cultural studies, which has some potentialities to move beyond the academy and open new dialogical spaces for communication and cultural intervention.},

Drawing on a variety of archival materials for evidence of the commission's thinking, this essay argues that the concept of accountability was originally intended as a guide to policy making and that, to appreciate the continuing relevance of the commission's work as a landmark in media studies, it is essential to understand the policy orientation that underlay most of its ideas and recommendations.},

While The 'Nationwide' Audience has been acclaimed as one of the most influential empirical works in audience studies, it has been often misunderstood as if the work failed to find out systemic and consistent influences of viewers' social conditions on decoding practices. On the contrary, by using a statistical method, this paper demonstrates that the audiences' decodings of the programme presented by Morley are in fact clearly patterned by their social positions. The findings reveal the over-determined effects of various social conditions such as class, gender, race and age. Particularly, the results seem to restore the importance of social class on the interpretive process, which has been displaced and ignored in many current media studies. Highlighting audiences' structural social positions, the reading patterns rediscovered here allow us to rebut not only the traditional Marxist view of class determinism but also any relativist accounts of cultural activity.},

Arguing for understanding media studies as a field, in Pierre Bourdieu 's sense of the term, this article explores the analytical and political limits of this paradigm and, by extension, the intellectual vision that proceeds from it. The author focuses specifically on the problems that proceed from this textualist model by examining its internal limitations and the questions and lines of critical analysis it forecloses. Against this model, the author argues that Pierre Bourdieu 's sociological theory offers a necessary corrective to the lack of self-reflexivity and critical insight that has resulted from the domidnance of this paradigm within media studies.},

This article will summarise this work, and will also explore how some of Williams's more general key theoretical concepts \textendash{} especially structure of feeling and selective tradition \textendash{} can be applied to the genre. Finally, it will argue that the 'sociological' turn, by which Williams sought to substitute description and explanation for judgement and canonisation as the central purposes of analysis, represents a more productive approach to science fiction studies than the kind of prescriptive criticism deployed by other avowedly 'neo-Marxist' works, such as Darko Suvin's Metamorphoses of Science Fiction and Fredric Jameson's Archaeologies of the Future.},

  abstract = {Raymond Williams and I arrived in Cambridge simultaneously in 1961, he from a long stint in adult education to a college Fellowship, I from a year's teaching in a Northern secondary modern school to an undergraduate place. It was hard to say which of us was more alienated. Williams had made the long trek from a rural working-class community in Wales to a college which seemed to judge people (as I was to find out later to my cost) by how often they dined at High Table. He looked and spoke more like a countryman than a don, and had a warmth and simplicity of manner which contrasted sharply with the suave, off-hand style of the upper middle class establishment. He never got used to the casual malice of the Senior Combination Room, and was to write years later, in a fine obituary of F.R. Leavis, that Cambridge was 'one of the rudest places on earth . . . shot through with cold, nasty and bloody-minded talk'. I found myself marooned within a student body where everyone seemed to be well over six foot, brayed rather than spoke, stamped their feet in cinemas at the feeblest joke and addressed each other like public meetings in intimate cafes. It was a toss-up which of us was going to make it.},

The President hoped to have a 'national symposium' to discuss whether a free press could truly exist in a for-profit media system. The Symposium on the Freedom of the Press brought together 120 public intellectuals to discuss the matter. Here, I attempt to reacquaint scholars with this forgotten collection of contributions on the subject. I specifically focus my analysis on two major themes: the way contributors define public interest and their response to Roosevelt's question as to whether a newspaper could only be edited in the interests of the 'counting room,' as he put it.},

It offers a new understanding of the role Lippmann played in yoking together a range of communication-related issues under a single problematic. In the process it exposes a critical lacunae stretching across (and beyond) scholarship in communications research: a lack of attention to the rhetorical deployment of Lippmann, characterized by an inclination to endow this figure's political philosophy with the power to stand in for a range of developments occurring across an emerging communications field. This essay addresses the implications of being positioned to speak not only for a field of research but for history as well, being able to so perfectly mirror shifts in cultural attitudes and emerging institutional practices.},

@article{zhengrong_retrospection_2013,
  abstract = {Transcending a one-dimensional paradigm of globalisation, this article provides a kind of archeological analysis of communication and journalism studies in China. It examines the historical trajectory of the introduction of Western communication theories since the early 1980s, the articulation of Western theories and the initiatives of Chinese intellectuals of the time, and the complex social contexts of a transitional China in which a dominant US-based administrative paradigm has prevailed for decades. As a result of this articulation, communication and journalism studies in current China are widely considered an organic part of the leading paradigm of neoliberalism, and less attention has been paid to seeking alternative paradigms, or at least to rediscovering the distinctiveness of Chinese experience in the global sphere. To point out the limitations of this articulation, the article illustrates the increasing difficulties or misappropriations in using those Western theories to interpret the complex reality of both social and media transformations. A positive relationship between theories and practice prompts social justice and democracy rather than a tendency towards '' uneven development'' with growing social inequality. Therefore the article contends that China's communication and journalism studies are standing at another historical crossroads today, compared with the time when Wilbur Schramm made his groundbreaking visit to Beijing in 1982. In pursuit of a reorientation in communication and journalism studies in the future, an integrated approach is suggested.},

The most recent challenge to journalism educators is the student protests which started at the end of 2015, questioning the high costs of education and demanding '' decolonization'' of curricula. The traditional alignment with media companies has also been upended as the drastic contraction of newsrooms removes the promise of jobs upon graduation and the swiftly shifting digital terrain rearranges the financial basis of all journalism. These factors introduce a dynamism and uncertainty into South African journalism that educators are compelled to respond to with imagination and principle.},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} This chapter maps the conceptual territory that research on school shootings shares with cultivation analysis. Methodology/approach \textendash{} It outlines the history of cultivation analysis, which used the statistical methods of content analysis and survey research to argue that television violence was rampant and sexist, and that this had the effect of making audiences fearful. The point of this history is to show that the model was conceptually grounded in critical approaches to media, and established questions about the ideology of media violence that set the grounds for school shooting studies. Findings \textendash{} In particular, the chapter focuses on similarities between cultivation analysis and ritual theory, and the cultivation thesis that violence represents gender hierarchies, as the two most obvious points of intersections with studies on school shootings. It suggests that these intersections help explain why a ``school shooting'' frame was deployed to other sorts of media violence, and debates about the effects of media violence, using Jared Loughner's attack on Gabrielle Giffords as a case study. Practical implications \textendash{} Emerging concerns about the effects of aggressive news punditry and political commentary can be addressed by reflecting on what studies of school shootings say about the more general politics of media violence, and cultivation theory is an invaluable resource in this endeavor. Originality/value of paper \textendash{} Academically, an engagement with cultivation theory underlines how school shooting studies contribute to critical media research in general, by demonstrating the validity of ``second generation'' models of media influence in the digital age},

The journal's beginnings may be dated first of all to the early 1950s, when an occasional mimeographed newsletter called The Film Teacher was launched under the banner of a newly formed membership organization calling itself the Society of Film Teachers.1 The Film Teacher was eventually to evolve into a periodical with a new name, with the first issue under its present title, Screen, appearing early in 1969. However, we have chosen to mark the journal's birth year as 1959, for this was when the society \textendash{} now more grandly and inclusively renamed the Society for Education in Film and Television (SEFT) \textendash{} published the first issue of a print journal that has appeared regularly, and without breaks, ever since: an impressive achievement in itself. No more than a pamphlet, the 1959 inaugural issue declared a concern with 'the impact of the visual media upon the young', with 'our' [that is, teachers'] role being to interpret these media, since 'all children should be trained to be '' intelligent viewers'''. The journal was called Screen Education (figure 1), and over the subsequent ten years, forty-five increasingly substantial numbered issues followed. By 1969, when the journal relaunched itself as Screen under new editorship, SEFT had become a grant-in-aid body of the British Film Institute (BFI).},

Rather than exploring interactions among African American friends, families, and lovers, communication researchers tended to position African Americans in relation to White Americans either by comparing Black and White communicative perceptions and practices or by examining interracial encounters. By overrepresenting the quest for difference, communication scholars inadvertently centered Whiteness in African American interpersonal scholarship. This article offers the following four touchstones for constructing alternative research narratives that interpret African American interpersonal communication from African American cultural standpoints. (a) practical and relational focus, (b) community cognizance, (c) holism and intersectionality, and (d) positionality and provisionalism.},

First, we offer a quantitative analysis of the extent to which the journals recognize semiotics as a legitimate area of concern. Second, we conduct a qualitative assessment of the few substantive contributions to semiotics in the communication literature in order to comprehend how the research conceives semiotics. We discuss both strengths and weaknesses of this very limited attention afforded semiotics and its relevance to promoting insightful semiotic scholarship more broadly in the communication discipline. Third, we contextualize our findings by suggesting that both implicit and explicit theoretical commitments incrementally imposed in the field's history and culture formed a barrier to advancing semiotic scholarship. Given a resurgence of interest in pragmatism (fueled by theoreticians such as C.S. Peirce, Dewey, Mead, and James), we end with a discussion of the relevance of semiotics to a fuller understanding of pragmatism. Our overall objectives are to stimulate interest in a neglected area of communication research and draw attention to the systematic research in communication and semiotics that has been pursued inside and ?outside? the mainstream disciplinary matrix.},

It identifies four primary reasons for these separate evolutionary trajectories, relating in turn to when and where the respective critiques have taken shape, and to the different cultural geographies and cultural products that they have each examined. These explanations are important, I argue, to the degree that they help to suggest ways in which the two debates might begin to feed into and constructively inform one another.

  abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: The Yale Journal of Criticism 13.2 (2000) 391-420 Introduction In 1999 Rudolf Maresch and Niels Werber co-edited a Suhrkamp volume entitled Kommunikation Medien Macht ("Communication Media Power") that aspired to reclaim the abandoned peaks of German philosophy. In their letter of invitation, the editors solicited contributions that would respond to "a philosophical, intellectual, creative and political challenge of the first order" by helping to merge the poststructuralist media theory of Friedrich Kittler with the autopoietic systems theory of Niklas Luhmann. With its focus on communication, media, and power as "the building blocks of the emerging global society," this {\"U}bertheory would be able to occupy "the place of the king that has been vacant since Hegel's death." Maresch and Werber argued that the strength of this royal hybrid would result from the partners' ability to correct each other's blind spots: Kittler would supply the technologically informed focus on the materialities of communication excluded by Luhmann, while Luhmann would provide a compatible understanding of communication, that is, a complementary analysis of how understanding, the construction of meaning, and social evolution emerge from the processing of communicative events, all of which is of little importance to Kittler. In short, the imperial theory would be made up of a combination of Kittlerian hardware and Luhmannian software. What is surprising \textendash{} not to mention entertaining \textendash{} is not only the retrieval of the lost belief in grand theory narratives, or the desire to introduce a double-headed alpha-male into an acephalous theory habitat, but also the evident gap between motion and act. Neither the contributors nor the editors really seem to believe in the feasibility of the project. The papers either stick to one of the theorists and disregard the other (and those that do discuss both tend to clearly favor one over the other), or both are abandoned and the authors happily present their own, homegrown, theories. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that given certain basic incompatibilities, some of which will be discussed below, the merger was doomed from the outset. But then why write about it, or why try to initiate it in the first place? Because in matters of theory \textendash{} just as in matters of love and business \textendash{} ambitious failure is a great deal more interesting and revealing than moderate success; and what makes this particular failure so intriguing is that it grows out of an exemplary move within the space of posthuman theorizing. Following N. Katherine Hayles, "posthuman" does not refer to the absence of humans but to a historically specific construction that recently emerged from the changing constellation of media, technology, and culture. As Hayles argues, the 'posthuman' is a point of view characterized by a set of (highly debatable) assumptions including the privileging of informational pattern over material instantiation, the debunking of consciousness "as an evolutionary upstart trying to claim that it is the whole show when in actuality it is only a minor sideshow," and, most importantly, the redesign of the "human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines." No doubt Luhmann and Kittler, whose theories are related to the project of rethinking the evolving human/machine and communication/consciousness boundaries, would share many of Hayles's objections, above all her critique of persisting notions of possessive individualism in the instrumentalist treatment of increasingly gadget-endowed bodies. But it is also clear that Kittler and Luhmann are not only posthuman thinkers in Hayles's sense of the word, they are clearly and unapologetically posthumanist: Luhmann for removing humans from their traditional place at the center of the analysis of social systems and replacing them with the autopoietic reproduction of communication, and Kittler for his claim that "so-called Man [der sogenannte Mensch] is not determined by attributes which philosophers confer on or suggest to people in order that they may better understand themselves; rather, He is determined by technical standards." In the case of both theorists, these post- or antihuman(ist) aspects are their most interesting features; and all the more so for the strange attempt to fuse them. In order to make sense of this quixotic endeavor, the following remarks will center on these aspects...},

As a specific example of policy research, the author describes the NIMH (National Institute of Mental Health) sponsored research on television and social behavior, and points out some shortcomings: an industry veto on advisory committee members, the failure of the advisory committee to specify the research question, and the pressure for a unanimous report which allowed the industry representatives to obscure the research findings. Unless social scientists learn from mistakes such as this, the author warns that policymakers are likely to stop consulting social scientists, and social policies will suffer.},

The discussion highlights the work of a number of under-valued authors, positing, in a provisional way, that where sociology remains drawn to an ethos of 'explanatory' causal reasoning, cultural studies typically occupies a register of evocative and engaged social 'description'. Despite the heuristic value of this schema, which casts light on more recent theoretical initiatives (such as'the method of articulation') as well as 'canonical' figures, the distinction between explanation and description is shown to be ultimately difficult to sustain. This reinforces the overall theme of the paper that whilst there are sometimes very different emphases at work within sociology and cultural studies, they need to be seen as complementary discourses operating within the same intellectual field.},

First, we provide a construction of the theory's main content. Second, we search for possibilities of enlarging the content and scope of his theory. Third, we reconstruct one of the basic underlying arguments of Willis' theory, that cultural items in themselves carry a given meaning in relation to social groups. In so doing we partly reconstruct Willis' understanding of 'objective' possibilities as something essentially given in time and space. We utilize the example of the car make Cadillac to demonstrate that cultural items also attract because they are already occupied by socioculturally constructed systems of meaning.},

  abstract = {In this paper we analyze a historical form of media literacy education that is still insufficiently discussed in English- language literature: Russian cineclubs. We focus on one particular cineclub that was created by a Soviet educator Oleg Baranov in the 1950s. We describe this cineclub's context and structure, and discuss its popularity among students. The content of Baranov's classes might have been shaped by ideological requirements of the time. However, we believe that the structure of his model can be used as an inspiration for a media literacy club in today's schools globally, and not only in Russia.},

But there is a strong consistency in sub- ject matter researched, submitted, and published, although some areas, like law and ethics, show recent increases. People seem to research what they teach and there is a consistency in our curricula programs over the past 17 years, judging from submissions.

At this juncture of a 40-year milestone, this paper implements a text analysis with keyword frequency data derived from the abstracts of papers published over the past 40 years to take a look at the big picture of key concepts that constitute the journal's research subjects. With keywords and bibliographic data, this paper calculates key research indexes to overview the dynamic changes in research focuses in the journal. This paper found that the differences in research performance across research subjects within three continents has declined over time, even though wide differences in research performance across subjects within nations still exist, and that the mid-1990s marked a watershed dividing the 40-year history into two parts.},

The other technology that has grown in importance since 1976\textemdash{}the Internet\textemdash{}is widely regarded as a raging success. Although no history is completely uniform, the past forty years illustrates the key considerations underlying the choice between whether to impose access regulations or whether to rely on facilities-based competition. Moreover, the paper considers the important role that U.S. courts have played in promoting competition and consumer welfare. In many cases, timely judicial intervention has forced regulators to retreat from positions that protected incumbents and limited competition. The paper concludes with outlooks on new issues and debates that will continue to arise.},

For some of these women, organizing was an occupational closure strategy of revolutionary usurpation: They may have hoped to position themselves favorably to shape a future profession that was not predicated on hidden forms of their inclusion. Exclusionary and demarcationary forces, however, seem to have ultimately undermined their efforts, alienating some of them and inducing others to adopt a strategy of inclusionary usurpation. In addition to using gender-sensitive revisions of occupational closure theory to explain the phenomenon of the woman organizer, the author chronicles the emergence of 8 professional associations for technical communicators and identifies the women technical communicators who helped to organize them.},

This essay highlights, critiques, and shows the continuing value and relevance of two works. Hall's (1975) Introduction to Paper Voices: The Popular Press and Social Change 1935-1965 is an excellent example of an early methodological intervention by Hall. It remains a highly useful manual for discourse analysis. Hall's pioneering 4-part model of encoding and decoding is used to illustrate a major theoretical intervention. Hall wrote '' Encoding and Decoding in the Television Discourse'' in 1973 for students at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies. The 1980 version is shorter and its politics somewhat tamed but even so it justifiably inspired considerable work on the articulation of producer and audience work.},

  abstract = {US-American sociology has largely failed to examine the transformation of mediated communication of the past 20 years. If sociology is to be conceived as a general social science concerned with analyzing and critically scrutinizing past, present, and future conditions of collective human existence, this failure, and the ignorance it engenders, is detrimental. This ignorance, we argue, may be traced back to the weak self-identity, institutionalization and position of media sociology in the discipline. Our argument here is threefold: 1) There was an opportunity structure for specialization, that is, a venerable research tradition in media sociology since the first half of the twentieth century. This tradition links back to classics in sociology and peaked at a time (1970s and 1980s) when the discipline differentiated institutionally and many new sections emerged in the American Sociological Association. 2) Despite this tradition, media sociology has not become established in sociology in the United States until recently. 3) Lastly, we locate reasons for non-establishment on three distinct but interconnected levels: the history of ideas in media sociology, institutional/disciplinary history, and disciplinary politics.},

We compared the results of our current analysis of 14,925 articles published in 72 Web of Science-ranked communication journals from 2013 to 2017 with Lauf's earlier data. We found that most leading journals still publish articles almost exclusively from the developed world, and we found the same bias regarding the composition of journal editorial boards. Analysis shows a decreasing contribution of the U.S., while Asia and Western Europe greatly increased their participation, and developing regions are still underrepresented. Our research shows that the field is still deliberately dominated by Western articles in Western journals edited by Western editorial board members. Given this, we suggest that the international community of communication scholars develop strategies to expand common standards for a more balanced international contribution pattern.},

A total of 80 empirical studies on IMC published between 2000 and 2015 are examined and systematically presented and discussed. IMC implementation, impact, perception, measurement and its relationship with technology emerge as five main research topics. Researchers seem to prefer quantitative research over qualitative and descriptive statistics analysis over more elaborated techniques. Europe is established as the top IMC research region, followed by America and Asia. Communication, education, retailing and tourism are the most frequently examined sectors, mostly approached from the managers' perspective. Owing to the fact that only a limited number of journal articles are reviewed, this contribution only offers a snapshot of the research field. However, the paper enables academics to discover possible directions for future IMC research. This work makes a novel contribution as it provides the first attempt to identify the emerging research on IMC in the last 15 years by presenting systematically 80 empirical studies according to their research objectives, implemented methods and data analyses, examined samples or units of analysis, covered geographical areas and sectors and, finally, research findings.},

  abstract = {Using Frank Kermode's (1967. The sense of an ending: studies in the theory of fiction with a new epilogue. Oxford: OUP) formulation of `the End' as its conceptual marker, this paper takes aim at pronouncements of cultural studies' demise. In recent years, it has become fashionable to declare cultural studies as in decline, if not irretrievably lost. In drawing on this conceptualization of `the End' to define the current status of cultural studies, attention will be given to how narratives of demise and decline claim a position of speaking-for the discipline whilst reifying selective moments of cultural studies' past as markers of a `high point', a halcyon moment from which the current malaise is contrasted. Arguing that this is a troubling dynamic, this paper works through the formulations that selected crisis narrative present to outline how these narratives gain dimension. The argument then moves to problematize the positioning of selective originary points within cultural studies' past to propose that a far more speculative appraisal of these halcyon moments might be drawn upon. Such `speculative recognition' of the past does not seek to dismiss cultural studies' histories, nor position these within simplistic generational divisions, but does seek to question the significance selective originary moments hold in defining prescriptions for the discipline's future.},
