  abstract = {Amid a broader reckoning about the role of social media in public life, this article argues that the same scrutiny can be applied to the journalism studies field and its approaches to examining social media. A decade later, what hath such research wrought? In the broad study of news and its digital transformation, few topics have captivated researchers quite like social media, with hundreds of studies on everything from how journalists use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat to how such platforms facilitate various forms of engagement between journalists and audiences. Now, some 10 years into journalism studies on social media, we need a more particular accounting of the assumptions, biases, and blind spots that have crept into this line of research. Our purpose is to provoke reflection and chart a path for future research by critiquing themes of what has come before. In particular, our goal is to untangle three faulty assumptions—often implicit but no less influential—that have been overlooked in the rapid take-up of social media as a key phenomenon for journalism studies: (1) that social media would be a net positive; (2) that social media reflects reality; and (3) that social media matters over and above other factors.},

Oxford: OUP) formulation of `the End' as its conceptual marker, this paper takes aim at pronouncements of cultural studies' demise. In recent years, it has become fashionable to declare cultural studies as in decline, if not irretrievably lost. In drawing on this conceptualization of `the End' to define the current status of cultural studies, attention will be given to how narratives of demise and decline claim a position of speaking-for the discipline whilst reifying selective moments of cultural studies' past as markers of a `high point', a halcyon moment from which the current malaise is contrasted. Arguing that this is a troubling dynamic, this paper works through the formulations that selected crisis narrative present to outline how these narratives gain dimension. The argument then moves to problematize the positioning of selective originary points within cultural studies' past to propose that a far more speculative appraisal of these halcyon moments might be drawn upon. Such `speculative recognition' of the past does not seek to dismiss cultural studies' histories, nor position these within simplistic generational divisions, but does seek to question the significance selective originary moments hold in defining prescriptions for the discipline's future.},

A total of 80 empirical studies on IMC published between 2000 and 2015 are examined and systematically presented and discussed. IMC implementation, impact, perception, measurement and its relationship with technology emerge as five main research topics. Researchers seem to prefer quantitative research over qualitative and descriptive statistics analysis over more elaborated techniques. Europe is established as the top IMC research region, followed by America and Asia. Communication, education, retailing and tourism are the most frequently examined sectors, mostly approached from the managers' perspective. Owing to the fact that only a limited number of journal articles are reviewed, this contribution only offers a snapshot of the research field. However, the paper enables academics to discover possible directions for future IMC research. This work makes a novel contribution as it provides the first attempt to identify the emerging research on IMC in the last 15 years by presenting systematically 80 empirical studies according to their research objectives, implemented methods and data analyses, examined samples or units of analysis, covered geographical areas and sectors and, finally, research findings.},

We compared the results of our current analysis of 14,925 articles published in 72 Web of Science-ranked communication journals from 2013 to 2017 with Lauf's earlier data. We found that most leading journals still publish articles almost exclusively from the developed world, and we found the same bias regarding the composition of journal editorial boards. Analysis shows a decreasing contribution of the U.S., while Asia and Western Europe greatly increased their participation, and developing regions are still underrepresented. Our research shows that the field is still deliberately dominated by Western articles in Western journals edited by Western editorial board members. Given this, we suggest that the international community of communication scholars develop strategies to expand common standards for a more balanced international contribution pattern.},

If sociology is to be conceived as a general social science concerned with analyzing and critically scrutinizing past, present, and future conditions of collective human existence, this failure, and the ignorance it engenders, is detrimental. This ignorance, we argue, may be traced back to the weak self-identity, institutionalization and position of media sociology in the discipline. Our argument here is threefold: 1) There was an opportunity structure for specialization, that is, a venerable research tradition in media sociology since the first half of the twentieth century. This tradition links back to classics in sociology and peaked at a time (1970s and 1980s) when the discipline differentiated institutionally and many new sections emerged in the American Sociological Association. 2) Despite this tradition, media sociology has not become established in sociology in the United States until recently. 3) Lastly, we locate reasons for non-establishment on three distinct but interconnected levels: the history of ideas in media sociology, institutional/disciplinary history, and disciplinary politics.},

The other technology that has grown in importance since 1976\textemdash{}the Internet\textemdash{}is widely regarded as a raging success. Although no history is completely uniform, the past forty years illustrates the key considerations underlying the choice between whether to impose access regulations or whether to rely on facilities-based competition. Moreover, the paper considers the important role that U.S. courts have played in promoting competition and consumer welfare. In many cases, timely judicial intervention has forced regulators to retreat from positions that protected incumbents and limited competition. The paper concludes with outlooks on new issues and debates that will continue to arise.},

At this juncture of a 40-year milestone, this paper implements a text analysis with keyword frequency data derived from the abstracts of papers published over the past 40 years to take a look at the big picture of key concepts that constitute the journal's research subjects. With keywords and bibliographic data, this paper calculates key research indexes to overview the dynamic changes in research focuses in the journal. This paper found that the differences in research performance across research subjects within three continents has declined over time, even though wide differences in research performance across subjects within nations still exist, and that the mid-1990s marked a watershed dividing the 40-year history into two parts.},

First, we provide a construction of the theory's main content. Second, we search for possibilities of enlarging the content and scope of his theory. Third, we reconstruct one of the basic underlying arguments of Willis' theory, that cultural items in themselves carry a given meaning in relation to social groups. In so doing we partly reconstruct Willis' understanding of 'objective' possibilities as something essentially given in time and space. We utilize the example of the car make Cadillac to demonstrate that cultural items also attract because they are already occupied by socioculturally constructed systems of meaning.},

The discussion highlights the work of a number of under-valued authors, positing, in a provisional way, that where sociology remains drawn to an ethos of 'explanatory' causal reasoning, cultural studies typically occupies a register of evocative and engaged social 'description'. Despite the heuristic value of this schema, which casts light on more recent theoretical initiatives (such as'the method of articulation') as well as 'canonical' figures, the distinction between explanation and description is shown to be ultimately difficult to sustain. This reinforces the overall theme of the paper that whilst there are sometimes very different emphases at work within sociology and cultural studies, they need to be seen as complementary discourses operating within the same intellectual field.},

  volume = {13},
  abstract = {In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content: The Yale Journal of Criticism 13.2 (2000) 391-420 Introduction In 1999 Rudolf Maresch and Niels Werber co-edited a Suhrkamp volume entitled Kommunikation Medien Macht ("Communication Media Power") that aspired to reclaim the abandoned peaks of German philosophy. In their letter of invitation, the editors solicited contributions that would respond to "a philosophical, intellectual, creative and political challenge of the first order" by helping to merge the poststructuralist media theory of Friedrich Kittler with the autopoietic systems theory of Niklas Luhmann. With its focus on communication, media, and power as "the building blocks of the emerging global society," this {\"U}bertheory would be able to occupy "the place of the king that has been vacant since Hegel's death." Maresch and Werber argued that the strength of this royal hybrid would result from the partners' ability to correct each other's blind spots: Kittler would supply the technologically informed focus on the materialities of communication excluded by Luhmann, while Luhmann would provide a compatible understanding of communication, that is, a complementary analysis of how understanding, the construction of meaning, and social evolution emerge from the processing of communicative events, all of which is of little importance to Kittler. In short, the imperial theory would be made up of a combination of Kittlerian hardware and Luhmannian software. What is surprising \textendash{} not to mention entertaining \textendash{} is not only the retrieval of the lost belief in grand theory narratives, or the desire to introduce a double-headed alpha-male into an acephalous theory habitat, but also the evident gap between motion and act. Neither the contributors nor the editors really seem to believe in the feasibility of the project. The papers either stick to one of the theorists and disregard the other (and those that do discuss both tend to clearly favor one over the other), or both are abandoned and the authors happily present their own, homegrown, theories. Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes clear that given certain basic incompatibilities, some of which will be discussed below, the merger was doomed from the outset. But then why write about it, or why try to initiate it in the first place? Because in matters of theory \textendash{} just as in matters of love and business \textendash{} ambitious failure is a great deal more interesting and revealing than moderate success; and what makes this particular failure so intriguing is that it grows out of an exemplary move within the space of posthuman theorizing. Following N. Katherine Hayles, "posthuman" does not refer to the absence of humans but to a historically specific construction that recently emerged from the changing constellation of media, technology, and culture. As Hayles argues, the 'posthuman' is a point of view characterized by a set of (highly debatable) assumptions including the privileging of informational pattern over material instantiation, the debunking of consciousness "as an evolutionary upstart trying to claim that it is the whole show when in actuality it is only a minor sideshow," and, most importantly, the redesign of the "human being so that it can be seamlessly articulated with intelligent machines." No doubt Luhmann and Kittler, whose theories are related to the project of rethinking the evolving human/machine and communication/consciousness boundaries, would share many of Hayles's objections, above all her critique of persisting notions of possessive individualism in the instrumentalist treatment of increasingly gadget-endowed bodies. But it is also clear that Kittler and Luhmann are not only posthuman thinkers in Hayles's sense of the word, they are clearly and unapologetically posthumanist: Luhmann for removing humans from their traditional place at the center of the analysis of social systems and replacing them with the autopoietic reproduction of communication, and Kittler for his claim that "so-called Man [der sogenannte Mensch] is not determined by attributes which philosophers confer on or suggest to people in order that they may better understand themselves; rather, He is determined by technical standards." In the case of both theorists, these post- or antihuman(ist) aspects are their most interesting features; and all the more so for the strange attempt to fuse them. In order to make sense of this quixotic endeavor, the following remarks will center on these aspects...},

These explanations are important, I argue, to the degree that they help to suggest ways in which the two debates might begin to feed into and constructively inform one another.

First, we offer a quantitative analysis of the extent to which the journals recognize semiotics as a legitimate area of concern. Second, we conduct a qualitative assessment of the few substantive contributions to semiotics in the communication literature in order to comprehend how the research conceives semiotics. We discuss both strengths and weaknesses of this very limited attention afforded semiotics and its relevance to promoting insightful semiotic scholarship more broadly in the communication discipline. Third, we contextualize our findings by suggesting that both implicit and explicit theoretical commitments incrementally imposed in the field's history and culture formed a barrier to advancing semiotic scholarship. Given a resurgence of interest in pragmatism (fueled by theoreticians such as C.S. Peirce, Dewey, Mead, and James), we end with a discussion of the relevance of semiotics to a fuller understanding of pragmatism. Our overall objectives are to stimulate interest in a neglected area of communication research and draw attention to the systematic research in communication and semiotics that has been pursued inside and ?outside? the mainstream disciplinary matrix.},

Rather than exploring interactions among African American friends, families, and lovers, communication researchers tended to position African Americans in relation to White Americans either by comparing Black and White communicative perceptions and practices or by examining interracial encounters. By overrepresenting the quest for difference, communication scholars inadvertently centered Whiteness in African American interpersonal scholarship. This article offers the following four touchstones for constructing alternative research narratives that interpret African American interpersonal communication from African American cultural standpoints. (a) practical and relational focus, (b) community cognizance, (c) holism and intersectionality, and (d) positionality and provisionalism.},

The journal's beginnings may be dated first of all to the early 1950s, when an occasional mimeographed newsletter called The Film Teacher was launched under the banner of a newly formed membership organization calling itself the Society of Film Teachers.1 The Film Teacher was eventually to evolve into a periodical with a new name, with the first issue under its present title, Screen, appearing early in 1969. However, we have chosen to mark the journal's birth year as 1959, for this was when the society \textendash{} now more grandly and inclusively renamed the Society for Education in Film and Television (SEFT) \textendash{} published the first issue of a print journal that has appeared regularly, and without breaks, ever since: an impressive achievement in itself. No more than a pamphlet, the 1959 inaugural issue declared a concern with 'the impact of the visual media upon the young', with 'our' [that is, teachers'] role being to interpret these media, since 'all children should be trained to be '' intelligent viewers'''. The journal was called Screen Education (figure 1), and over the subsequent ten years, forty-five increasingly substantial numbered issues followed. By 1969, when the journal relaunched itself as Screen under new editorship, SEFT had become a grant-in-aid body of the British Film Institute (BFI).},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} This chapter maps the conceptual territory that research on school shootings shares with cultivation analysis. Methodology/approach \textendash{} It outlines the history of cultivation analysis, which used the statistical methods of content analysis and survey research to argue that television violence was rampant and sexist, and that this had the effect of making audiences fearful. The point of this history is to show that the model was conceptually grounded in critical approaches to media, and established questions about the ideology of media violence that set the grounds for school shooting studies. Findings \textendash{} In particular, the chapter focuses on similarities between cultivation analysis and ritual theory, and the cultivation thesis that violence represents gender hierarchies, as the two most obvious points of intersections with studies on school shootings. It suggests that these intersections help explain why a ``school shooting'' frame was deployed to other sorts of media violence, and debates about the effects of media violence, using Jared Loughner's attack on Gabrielle Giffords as a case study. Practical implications \textendash{} Emerging concerns about the effects of aggressive news punditry and political commentary can be addressed by reflecting on what studies of school shootings say about the more general politics of media violence, and cultivation theory is an invaluable resource in this endeavor. Originality/value of paper \textendash{} Academically, an engagement with cultivation theory underlines how school shooting studies contribute to critical media research in general, by demonstrating the validity of ``second generation'' models of media influence in the digital age},

  abstract = {Transcending a one-dimensional paradigm of globalisation, this article provides a kind of archeological analysis of communication and journalism studies in China. It examines the historical trajectory of the introduction of Western communication theories since the early 1980s, the articulation of Western theories and the initiatives of Chinese intellectuals of the time, and the complex social contexts of a transitional China in which a dominant US-based administrative paradigm has prevailed for decades. As a result of this articulation, communication and journalism studies in current China are widely considered an organic part of the leading paradigm of neoliberalism, and less attention has been paid to seeking alternative paradigms, or at least to rediscovering the distinctiveness of Chinese experience in the global sphere. To point out the limitations of this articulation, the article illustrates the increasing difficulties or misappropriations in using those Western theories to interpret the complex reality of both social and media transformations. A positive relationship between theories and practice prompts social justice and democracy rather than a tendency towards '' uneven development'' with growing social inequality. Therefore the article contends that China's communication and journalism studies are standing at another historical crossroads today, compared with the time when Wilbur Schramm made his groundbreaking visit to Beijing in 1982. In pursuit of a reorientation in communication and journalism studies in the future, an integrated approach is suggested.},

It offers a new understanding of the role Lippmann played in yoking together a range of communication-related issues under a single problematic. In the process it exposes a critical lacunae stretching across (and beyond) scholarship in communications research: a lack of attention to the rhetorical deployment of Lippmann, characterized by an inclination to endow this figure's political philosophy with the power to stand in for a range of developments occurring across an emerging communications field.

He looked and spoke more like a countryman than a don, and had a warmth and simplicity of manner which contrasted sharply with the suave, off-hand style of the upper middle class establishment. He never got used to the casual malice of the Senior Combination Room, and was to write years later, in a fine obituary of F.R. Leavis, that Cambridge was 'one of the rudest places on earth . . . shot through with cold, nasty and bloody-minded talk'. I found myself marooned within a student body where everyone seemed to be well over six foot, brayed rather than spoke, stamped their feet in cinemas at the feeblest joke and addressed each other like public meetings in intimate cafes.

While The 'Nationwide' Audience has been acclaimed as one of the most influential empirical works in audience studies, it has been often misunderstood as if the work failed to find out systemic and consistent influences of viewers' social conditions on decoding practices. On the contrary, by using a statistical method, this paper demonstrates that the audiences' decodings of the programme presented by Morley are in fact clearly patterned by their social positions. The findings reveal the over-determined effects of various social conditions such as class, gender, race and age. Particularly, the results seem to restore the importance of social class on the interpretive process, which has been displaced and ignored in many current media studies. Highlighting audiences' structural social positions, the reading patterns rediscovered here allow us to rebut not only the traditional Marxist view of class determinism but also any relativist accounts of cultural activity.},

The paper presents his thoughts on the past 10 years of marketing scholarship, his views on future directions and some advice for those looking to publish their research in academic journals. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a reflective, discursive approach, and also reviews a wide range of topics relevant to marketing researchers. Findings The author finds that EJM has grown substantially on many levels in the past decade. He also finds that there are some concerns around marketing research, and social scientific scholarship in general, that marketing scholars may wish to consider and take into account in their ongoing work. Research limitations/implications The paper is partly a personal view, and does not rely on any empirical research. However, the views espoused are justified by theoretical review and conceptual argument. Practical implications The implications of this paper are relevant to marketing scholars, journal reviewers, readers of research, as well as those who manage scholarship (e.g. university administrators). The author suggests a number of directions that the research, publication and reward process could move in to improve practice.

  abstract = {Coined in the 1920s as a way to describe radio, motion pictures, wide-circulation magazines, and the press, the term "mass communication" frequently is misused in the era of cable TV, niche marketing, and the Internet. In Refiguring Mass Communication, Peter Simonson compares his own vision of mass communication with distinct views articulated throughout history by Paul of Tarsus, Walt Whitman, Charles Horton Cooley, David Sarnoff, and Robert K. Merton, utilizing a collection of texts and tenets from a variety of time periods and perspectives. Drawing on textual and archival research as well as access to Merton's personal papers, Simonson broadly reconceives a sense of communication theory and what social processes might be considered species of mass communication. Simonson reveals the geographical and social contexts from which these visions have emerged and the religious and moral horizons against which they have taken shape. In a unique perspective, he considers the American county fair as an example of a live gathering and crucial site that is overlooked in contemporary forms of mass communication, urging a reconsideration of how individuals participate in and shape similar forms.},

This introductory essay illustrates the needs for such a volume to fill an important gap in IC history, provides a rationale for focusing on the 1970s, and discusses the current state of documenting various expressions of the intercultural discipline. It highlights the value of biography as one historical window from which to review or reconstruct the social history derived from the interdisciplinary influences and outcomes of IC or related intercultural fields. After a brief review of earlier people and tracks that influenced the field's eventual formation, it provides categorical and chronological summaries of people and their initiatives in and around the 1970s that established IC, the rationale that guided inclusions or omissions for this '' selected'' set of biographies, and highlights other worthy influencers not profiled. This essay provides an overview for the questions that contributing authors were asked to address about each person featured in this special issue: (1) the ways they founded, influenced, or affected the ongoing IC field or related intercultural work, (2) the topics or domains that they influenced, (3) the lines or types of IC they launched and outcomes of their legacies, and (4) the principles, practices, or personal characteristics those in the field now can reconsider as catalysts for renewal or future developments.},

It is argued that these accounts constitute rituals of disciplinary affirmation. The second group has as its method intellectual history, and focuses on the theoretical foundations of ideas taken up by communication scholars, tracing the relations among ideology, culture, technology, and communication. These accounts, on the other hand, are read as polite rebellions against received understandings of communication history.},

He demonstrates that, while attitudes toward audiences have shifted over time, Americans have always judged audiences against standards of good citizenship. From descriptions of tightly packed crowds in early American theaters to the contemporary reports of distant, anonymous Internet audiences, Butsch examines how audiences were represented in contemporary discourse. He explores a broad range of sources on theater, movies, propaganda, advertising, broadcast journalism, and much more. Butsch discovers that audiences were characterized according to three recurrent motifs: as crowds and as isolated individuals in a mass, both of which were considered bad, and as publics which were considered ideal audiences. These images were based on and reinforced class and other social hierarchies. At times though, subordinate groups challenged their negative characterization in these images, and countered with their own interpretations. A remarkable work of cultural criticism and media history, this book is essential reading for anyone seeking an historical understanding of how audiences, media and entertainment function in the American cultural and political imagination.},

By mid-century, mass communications researchers had become recognized as experts in describing the effects of the mass media on learning and other social behavior. However, the conditions that promoted and sustained their authority as experts have not been adequately explored.

This storyline, first narrated in Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's Personal Influence (1955), remains textbook boilerplate and literature review dogma fifty years later. The dissertation traces the emergence of this '' powerful-to-limited effects'' disciplinary legend, with special emphasis on the surprising contributions of sociologist Edward Shils, the mandarin theorist and intellectual maverick with little interest in the empirical study of media. In the crucial postwar years, Shils provided an account of the disappearance and reemergence of '' small group'' research, which he framed as a contrast between pictures of society\textemdash{}between the mistaken European view of impersonal isolation as against his view, that Gemeinschaft elements endure. Shils's treatment of small-group research, and especially his embedding of that story in terms of societal imagery, was essential to the field's mnemonic emplotment. Shils had his own intellectual reasons for narrating the history in the manner that he did\textemdash{}reasons rooted in his evolving and deeply engaged search for the underpinnings of modern social order. In a sense, however, his reasons did not matter once the narrative itself was released to the American sociological public; Lazarsfeld and Katz had their own reasons for adopting the historical picture that Shils put forward\textemdash{}reasons largely centered on scholarly competition and norms of originality. The powerful-to-limited-effects narrative in Personal Influence, in turn, was so widely embraced in the late 1950s for a still-different set of reasons\textemdash{}because of the scholarly support it lent to the public intellectual defense of American popular culture, in the context of an evolving Cold War liberalism. The staying power of this limited-effects narrative was ultimately guaranteed, however, by the newly institutionalized, would-be discipline of '' communication''\textemdash{}which retained the storyline as a usable, and teachable, past.},

  abstract = {Scholars exploring the 'problem' of propaganda and democracy, or the history of propaganda and warfare, or the history of American mass communications research, consistently have marked World War I as the point at which the 'idea of propaganda' emerged in the modern era. Historians note that democratic governments had never relied so heavily on elaborate propaganda campaigns as part of their 'total war' ammunition; and never before, it seems, had the democratic citizenry been so manipulated. From the end of the World War I through World War II, a generation of American social critics, political theorists, and government officials were acutely aware that propaganda was ubiquitous, powerful, and a potentially highly destabilizing weapon of political warfare. My study explores the relationship between three important political and intellectual tendencies in mid-twentieth century America: Elite concerns about the rise of 'mass society' and its purported threat to democracy; the growth of American social sciences and the emergence of communications research as a response to the challenges of mass society; and the growth of centralized state power, particularly the state's expanding capacity for marginalizing and controlling political dissent. My dissertation is not a study of the production or dissemination of propaganda, or of different psychological warfare campaigns. Rather, I am concerned with fears about propaganda and how those fears shaped social critics' political assumptions, social scientists' analytical techniques, and government lawyers' frameworks for the purposes of mobilizing for war and creating and enforcing an administrative and prosecutory propaganda 'prophylaxis.' My research and analysis combines traditional concerns of political history with the strategies of intellectual history and the insights of the new cultural studies to explore the contradictions and tensions at the heart of twentieth-century liberal thought and action.},

Until now, accounts about how public opinion research began in Mexico either ignored Radv{\'a}nyi's works or reduced his ten years of survey research to a single footnote.

  volume = {9},
  abstract = {This paper examines the ways academic discourses shaped the field of American independent cinema. Through a discussion of a large number of works that examined the question of independent filmmaking in the USA and were published from the 1940s onwards, the paper provides a number of distinctions between particular approaches to what constitutes American independent cinema, and in effect offers a history of film criticism on the subject. More specifically, it groups work in the field under five different categories, each driven by agendas and objectives that were often conflicting.

  abstract = {This paper examines the ways academic discourses shaped the field of American independent cinema. Through a discussion of a large number of works that examined the question of independent filmmaking in the USA and were published from the 1940s onwards, the paper provides a number of distinctions between particular approaches to what constitutes American independent cinema, and in effect offers a history of film criticism on the subject. More specifically, it groups work on the field under five different categories, each driven by agendas and objectives that were often conflicting. This conflict can be seen most clearly during the 1980s when a particular group of scholars examined American independent cinema as intricately linked to the Hollywood film industry and the studios while a second cluster of academic researchers located independent film completely outside the mainstream and as part of alternative media.

Many applications have the potential to make major contributions in meeting the needs of an unhealthy and aging population. Key questions confronting health communication research reflect long-standing concerns about effects of new technology on health knowledge, health behavior, health delivery, and health outcomes. A review of the literature provides useful insights about how technology has been used to communicate health messages and their associated outcomes. Focus is placed on effective health communication, lessons learned, and implications for the future. During the next 10 years, the application of new technologies in health communication will be enriched by a tradition that has evolved to reflect a more dynamic connection between health users and providers. Future applications have the potential to provide cost-effective communications tailored to large numbers of individuals and achieve positive health outcomes. Consequently, we should strive to answer research questions about tailoring communication content, the channel used to deliver the message, and evaluation models that are best suited for examining outcomes of multicomponent tailored, technology-based communication.},

The traumas of World War II, the Holocaust, the failure of reason to prevent war and genocide, the threat of thermonuclear war, the limitations of the Enlightenment, logical positivism, the analytic philosophical tradition, and the reduction of rhetoric to the elements of style as envisioned by Ramus, moved Hannah Arendt, Michael Polyani, Kenneth Burke, Stephen Toulmin, Cha{\"i}m Perelman, and Lucie Olbrechts-Tyteca, and others, to recover and renew rhetoric.},

Based on visualizations, we draw a sociotechnical timeline of protest and media technology scholarship within three dimensions: technological development, methods and techniques, and the social phenomena under investigation. The article concludes by identifying major trends in protest and media technologies scholarship over the past 15 years. The sociotechnical timeline enhances our understanding of academic discourse at the intersection of protest and media technologies by highlighting shortcomings and potential for future research.},

In the process, 'senders' have become complex organisations embedded in the power system of society, 'messages' have become a part of culture more generally and 'the audience' is situ- ated within multiple cultural and social contexts. Models have become more interactive, but have they changed enough?

Second, I argue that the recent reinvention of Lippmann holds the potential to reanimate Carey's articulation of communication and cultural studies.

  abstract = {Voter studies conducted in the United States during the first decades after World War II transformed social scientific research on democracy. Especially important were the rapid innovations in survey research methods developed by two prominent research centers at Columbia University and the University of Michigan. This article argues that the Columbia and Michigan voter studies presented two visions for research on democracy. Where the Michigan research produced quantitative measures expressing the 'political behavior' of the electorate, the Columbia studies, and especially Paul F. Lazarsfeld, presented an alternative vision for qualitative research on political choice. Largely ignored by later voter studies, this vision prefigured much contemporary research on democracy that embraces a qualitative or interpretive approach. This article reconstructs Lazarsfeld's alternative vision, describes the institutional context in which scholars disregarded it in favor of formal quantitative models, and argues for its recognition as a forerunner to qualitative research on democratic processes.},

How can we use his communicative materialism today for understanding digital communication? Williams advanced a materialist understanding of communication. His elements of a materialist communication theory help us to illuminate communication in the context of the base/superstructure problem, and ideology as a peculiar form of instrumental communication. He provides concepts that we need for a materialist understanding of digital media. The article concludes that we need the approach of communicative materialism for grounding a Marxist theory of communication that is relevant to the analysis of digital media.

Design/methodology/approach - This paper utilises Australian-held primary and official industry association material to present a more detailed and revisionist history of PR education in Australia in its foundation decades. Findings - This paper, which locates Australia's first public relations education initiatives in Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide in the 1960s, contests the only published account of PR education history by Potts (1976). The orthodox account, which has been repeated uncritically by later writers, overlooks earlier initiatives, such as the Melbourne-based Public Relations Institute of Australia, whose persistence resulted in Australia's first PR course at Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in 1964. So too, educational initiatives in Adelaide and Sydney pre-date the traditional historiography. Originality/value - A detailed literature review suggests this paper represents the only journal-length piece on the history of public relations education in Australia. It is also the first examination of relationships between industry, professional institutes, and educational authorities.},

For the first time representatives could discern people's opinions on virtually any public issue. Despite this ability, three important questions remain. Are people adequately informed to consider the complex problems of modern government? Will they give their true opinions to a pollster? And even if these two conditions are satisfied, do representatives have to be bound by popular opinion? This article argues that modern public opinion analysts who use polling data tend to ignore these questions and instead focus on patterns of attitudes among various groups in the population. Before scientific polling became common, those who studied public opinion directed their efforts to the connection between behavioral manifestations of public opinion and the development of public policy. They worried more about the role of public opinion in the formulation of public policy. It turns out that much of the public opinion literature preceding scientific polling remains relevant, and we ignore it at our peril.},

Traditionally-trained psychologists used the new medium of radio in the service of education and adjustment.

By the late 1930s, the epistemic germ of propaganda analysis was weakened by the growing tendency to equate science with statistical and experimental methods; and its ideological roots were withered by attacks on social critics and demands for academe to aid in national mobilization.

The communications industry has countered that propaganda merely circulates socially useful information in an efficient manner and further, that propaganda is harmless to democracy because of competition and professional codes. This study critically examines these various schools of thought in an effort to determine and understand the contribution and effects of propaganda in a democratic society.},

He began with the question of how film could be understood and studied as medium of communication, and from there, he moved on to larger and more profound questions about the nature of visual media in general and the role that visual images play in shaping and constructing reality. He is perhaps best known for the '' Navajo Film Project'' that he conducted with anthropologist John Adair in which they gave 16mm cameras to Navajo residents of the Pine Springs, Arizona reservation in order to explore how people who had never made or used movies would do so for the first time. How would their movies reflect their own culture and their ways of seeing and telling about their experiences? The book, Through Navajo Eyes, included here, became enormously influential in the fields of anthropology, communication and cinema studies, among others. In The Complete Sol Worth, editors Larry Gross and Jay Ruby collect all of Sol Worth's published writings, as well as some unpublished writings, extensive photo essays, and articles about Worth's work. Sol Worth's work remains relevant and influential in visual communication and anthropology, and the e-book format enables an accessible collection of the entirety of his contributions. Readers can also access Teaterri, a video documentary that Worth produced which is part of a permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. We hope this collection will introduce new readers to Sol Worth's contribution to bettering our understanding of visual communication, culture, and life.One of the central figures in the development of the study of visual communication, Sol Worth (1922-1977) was a filmmaker and painter before he turned to academic pursuits.

It would perhaps be a risky, ridiculous, and disingenuous enterprise to position Adorno as either an enthusiast or a fan. Rather, being an '' uncompromisingly critical thinker'' (kompromi\textbackslash{}s slos kritisch Denkende) is Adorno's preferred approach to philosophizing culture. Yet Hellings argues that Adorno's conceptualization of being uncompromising unintentionally supports an amorous subject and comportment, which is not altogether dissimilar to being an enthusiastic fan. This article, therefore, reads Adorno's philosophy of culture against the grain, and it does so by focusing on a constellation of concepts: fan, fanatic, fanaticism, Schw{\"a}rmerei, Begeisterung, playfulness, and love. The article attempts to salvage a notion of critical fandom in and against Adorno: to give serious and uncompromising participants of (popular) culture a chance. This attempted rescue is intended to allow for a more extensive reconsideration of the relations between philosophy and fandom.},

Each of these books has played a challenging role in shaping my own approaches to teaching (and learning), first as a secondary school teacher and later as a college faculty member.

The results suggest that cultural studies is experiencing a fast academic expansion. While this seems to be entangled with top-down institutional changes, in the wake of the Bologna process and the turn to the cultural/ creative industries and as part of a more general shift to the `new economy', there are reasons to believe that al-ternative understandings of cultural studies have not died out. The name `cultural studies' continues to cause unease in some academic quarters (namely, in literary studies) and there is ambiguity regarding what is meant by it. Cautioning against the tendency to reduce Portuguese cultural studies to a straightforward import from the Anglophone world, I argue for the need to conduct historically informed research on local strands and traditions of cultural theory and critique. I conclude that only a combined synchronic and diachronic approach \textendash{} one that is sensitive to national and transnational contexts and intersections \textendash{} will allow us to gain a bet-ter understanding of the deep-running contradictions that characterise the field, helping us to clarify the stakes and reconnect to a socially relevant and critique-orientated intellectual project.},

This article argues that this marginalization is, in part, the by-product of long-standing disciplinary debates over the inadequate political development of the American public. To develop this argument, the article first surveys the work of early political scientists, such as John Burgess and Woodrow Wilson, to show that their reformist ambitions largely precluded discussion of mundane activities of social life such as popular culture. It then turns to Harold Lasswell, who produced some of the first investigations of popular culture in American political science.

Roosevelt, faced with a constricting party apparatus and hostile relations with the media and Congress, sought to strengthen the executive branch in order to achieve a measure of independence from the Democratic Party, the media, or Congress. Polls, we argue, allowed Roosevelt and subsequent presidents to gauge public opinion without the consent of parties, the media, or Congress. Emil Hurja's polls for the DNC and Hadley Cantril's polling for Roosevelt explain this new function of the presidency. Emil Hurja disseminated poll data to the president, employing statistical techniques that began to obviate the local Democratic party as an institutional conduit between the electorate and the executive branch. Hadley Cantril was more than a poll data disseminator; he was also a media and communications advisor. Roosevelt's advisors used private polls as vehicles to advance the president's legislative and public relations agendas, and as instruments to measure the popularity of policies not yet codified and candidates not yet announced. Thanks to these polls, Roosevelt had a secret weapon that loosened the bonds previously preventing the executive branch from becoming the leadership vehicle he envisioned it to be. Of the ways in which the executive branch began to grow under Roosevelt, the assimilation of public opinion polls and the advice that accompanied them as an accepted function of the presidency signaled a historic change in the evolution of American politics.},

  abstract = {Contrary to the prevailing view in media and cultural studies, philosopher John Dewey and journalist Walter Lippmann did not represent different schools of thought. They were not adversaries in a great public debate about the fate of the public in modern democracies in the 1920s. Rather, their exchange about the '' phantom'' public was reframed as a conflict in the early 1980s, a reframing which has achieved broad interdisciplinary acceptance even though its rests on a casual rhetorical trope, not historical documentation. The reframing provides a salutary but inaccurate origin story for American media and cultural studies, illustrates the hazards of relying on secondary interpretations of historical sources, and deflects attention away from realistic assessment of the problems confronting democracy today. Dismantling this disciplinary folklore is essential to the integrity of the emerging '' new history'' of media and communication.},

By his manyfold activities, Paul Lazarsfeld decisively promoted the institutionalization of empirical social research. All these merits make him the founder of modern empirical sociology.},

  abstract = {This article analyzes Paul Lazarsfeld's 1941 book, Radio and the Printed Page, arguing for the book's enduring significance in communication and media studies. In the book, Lazarsfeld rejected the then-influential technological determinist model that Hadley Cantril and Gordon Allport had developed through studying the new medium of radio. In contrast to Cantril and Allport, Lazarsfeld found through studying Americans' listening and reading habits that radio's effects on society were not totalizing, and he discovered that radio not only did not diminish the importance of reading printed texts, but that it in fact may have encouraged the practice. The book established Lazarsfeld's scholarly reputation in the United States and formed the basis for his later and widely influential research. Long ignored in the intellectual history of media studies, Radio and the Printed Page is in fact a foundational work, one that contains the clear beginnings of the social constructivist ideas that Lazarsfeld would later articulate in The People's Choice and Personal Influence. Ultimately, the work presented a theory understanding media effects as significant but not totalizing, analyzed how people made meaning of media content through everyday social life, and demonstrated the continuing relevance of print in a world increasingly linked together by newer forms of media.

The Bureau's work under the guidance of Lazarsfeld is shown to have grown from an interplay of methodological or theoretical needs, of funds, of concrete subjects for study, and finally of findings that in turn create new methodological or theoretical needs.

As a result, studies often either examine all 3 approaches in a single study or employ very similar research designs, paying little attention to conceptual differences or differences in the levels of analysis under which each approach is operating. In this article, I revisit agenda-setting, priming, and framing as distinctively different approaches to effects of political communication. Specifically, I argue against more recent attempts to subsume all 3 approaches under the broad concept of agenda-setting and for a more careful explication of the concepts and of their theoretical premises and roots in social psychology and political psychology. Consequently, it calls for a reformulation of relevant research questions and a systematic categorization of research on agenda-setting, priming, and framing. An analytic model is developed that should serve as a guideline for future research in these areas.},

I suggest that research attending to topics related to bodily health challenges focused on whether popular media accurately or appropriately represented health challenges. The implication was that there is some consensus about more right or wrong, complete or incomplete ways of representing an issue; the problem was that the media are generally wrong. Alternatively, research addressing topics related to sociocultural context issues focused on how certain interests are privileged in the media. The implication was that competing groups are making claims on the system, but the problem was that popular media marginalizes certain interests. In short, popular media is not likely to facilitate understandings helpful to individuals coping with health challenges and is likely to perpetuate social and political power differentials with regard to health-related issues. I conclude by offering some possibilities for future health media content research.},

Over more than 40 years, the unfolding development of the Internet and related information and communication technologies has been one of the most dynamic areas of technological and social innovation worldwide. In the first decade of the twenty-first century, its development was even more dramatic. While innovations in such areas as search, social media, big data, and the commercialization of the Internet became prominent only over the last decade, they are already taken for granted by most Internet users. It is becoming increasingly apparent to us that this interdisciplinary field must broaden even further to better connect with fields beyond the social sciences and information, communication, media and cultural studies to include stronger collaborative ties to law, ethics, and the sciences, engineering, and computer sciences, but also across the arts and humanities. This will be an almost certain requirement for interdisciplinary research over the coming decade with technology and society moving at Internet time.},

It deals with the historical development of the relationship of media, culture, society, and the public. It traces the development of different notions of culture, their impacts on the media, and their relationships to various conceptions of ``the public''. It draws on this history to explore current debates about the influences of the media and society on public life. In the first part, the paper deals with some issues of the relation between theories of communication and theories of society. It grounds the study of the media and communication in the classical social theory and in the context of liberal pragmatism (Chicago School). It tries to answer the questions such as how Dewey, Lippman, Mead, et al. conceptualize the media and communications and what theoretical assumptions underlie liberal pragmatism. Further, it seeks to explore the differences between Mass Communication research (Media Effects Tradition) and Critical Theory (the Frankfurt School). The main question in this section is how the ideas of thinkers associated with the ``critical'' tradition compare with those of the ``liberal'' and ``media effects'' traditions. The article also focuses on the differences between British Cultural Studies and the American version of cultural studies. Lastly, it reviews the debate in Feminist and Audience approaches to the media.},

He was born in Vienna, Austria and was interested in empirical research because he was trained as a mathematician and partly because empirical social research was of considerable political interest in that time of a rapidly rising Labor party in Austria. He states that in Austria, doing empirical research on the situation of the working class was of very great political importance because it clarified the importance of social stratification. In empirical research, he asserts that one has to distinguish between university organizations, university institutes and the increasing number of commercial research organizations. He claims that the structural elements of a good research bureau have two educational advantages. First, the relation between the project director and his assistant is much more intimate than between a graduate assistant and his graduate student. Second, it forces a much greater clarification of elements involved in research. He claims that there is a simple distinction between the department and the bureau. A full professor cannot tell an assistant professor or even an instructor what to do, that guarantees a famous academic freedom. In a bureau, the director hands to certain staff members certain tasks.},

Answering to the question on the issues and problems that confronted him when he first entered the research field Nielsen said that, the most serious problem involved the raising of the necessary capital. He had always feared failure due to inadequate capital, and to make sure that this would not be the fate of the new Nielsen Company, he made careful estimates of the amount required and then raised three times that amount. He was aided by members of his fraternity, Sigma Phi, at the University of Wisconsin, who did not really understand the nature of the work the company proposed to undertake, but who had developed confidence in him because they had seen him working day and night to break the records for a scholarship in the College of Engineering\textendash{} records, incidentally, which have not yet been equaled. On asking Nielsen, about his unique contribution in the field he said that, there were several, and they did not all occur at the start. The first was the performance surveys. They were very useful to nearly every client who subscribed to this service. However, it was difficult to persuade the typical client to purchase a sufficient variety of these surveys to enable his salesmen to use them successfully with any type of prospect for his product and so that he could pile proof on proof to an extent which achieved conviction on the part of the prospect.},

He began with the question of how film could be understood and studied as medium of communication, and from there, he moved on to larger and more profound questions about the nature of visual media in general and the role that visual images play in shaping and constructing reality. He is perhaps best known for the '' Navajo Film Project'' that he conducted with anthropologist John Adair in which they gave 16mm cameras to Navajo residents of the Pine Springs, Arizona reservation in order to explore how people who had never made or used movies would do so for the first time. How would their movies reflect their own culture and their ways of seeing and telling about their experiences? The book, Through Navajo Eyes, included here, became enormously influential in the fields of anthropology, communication and cinema studies, among others. In The Complete Sol Worth, editors Larry Gross and Jay Ruby collect all of Sol Worth's published writings, as well as some unpublished writings, extensive photo essays, and articles about Worth's work. Sol Worth's work remains relevant and influential in visual communication and anthropology, and the e-book format enables an accessible collection of the entirety of his contributions. Readers can also access Teaterri, a video documentary that Worth produced which is part of a permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

How effective are such campaigns in changing health-related attitudes and behaviors, however, and how has the literature in this area progressed over the past decade? The purpose of the current article is threefold. First, I discuss the importance of health mass media campaigns and raise the question of whether they are capable of effectively impacting public health. Second, I review the literature and discuss what we have learned about the effectiveness of campaigns over the past 10 years. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of possible avenues for the health campaign literature over the next 10 years. The overriding conclusion is the following: The literature is beginning to amass evidence that targeted, well-executed health mass media campaigns can have small-to-moderate effects not only on health knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, but on behaviors as well, which can translate into major public health impact given the wide reach of mass media. Such impact can only be achieved, however, if principles of effective campaign design are carefully followed.},

However, the nature of the discipline often remains unclear, while its identity is typically determined by administrative conven- ience and market demand rather than analysis of its historical development and scholarly position within the system of arts and sciences. This chapter discusses the nature and ter- minology of the discipline, with examples of Finland and other Nordic countries, and it advocates the need for a continuous self-assessment of the research community.},

Although some successful and influential attempts of empirical and social research were made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the tradition of regular research was not established before World War II. Until the late 1950s, empirical social sciences did not exist in the Soviet Union. Instead of research, society was described by using ideological construction of the Communist Party history. Attitudes toward sociology started to change in the middle of the 1960s. Empirical sociological research expanded into many areas of study and began to spread across the country. Sociology deserved official recognition and was very popular in society; sociologists enjoyed both official and popular prestige.

As this article demonstrates, these assumptions continue to operate in the literature today. In updating the normative orientations that inform political communication research, the analysis focuses on certain research agendas as exemplar efforts of a changed philosophical position, called neoconservatism, which undergirds and structures studies critical of press performance. In particular, we critically examine 3 research programs in political communication that adhere to the field's formative intellectual assumptions as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis. Suggestions are made for a fuller integration of communication perspectives into political communication research as well as new ways of thinking about media in relation to politics.},

I argue that media sociology has been at its most vibrant when its goal has been to understand the dominant cultural structures that shape the public sphere. Robert Park was the first sociologist to adopt this perspective, with his research on newspapers and the power of the press. This interest continued into the 1950s, with research on media and propaganda. By the 1960s, however, concern had shifted away from the public character of media, focusing instead on the ways in which social factors intervened between media messages and society. While important, this shift in analytical focus ultimately led to a more reductionist media sociology, which failed to explore how media provided a distinctive type of social output. There is evidence that a less reductionist media sociology has begun to emerge since the 1990s, with the rise of cultural sociology and theories of the public sphere. This new media sociology could increase its visibility within mainstream sociology by making more explicit connections to the Chicago School tradition, and by claiming Robert Park as its classical founder.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to introduce cultural techniques to an Anglophone readership. Specifically geared towards an Anglophone readership, the paper relates the re-emergence of cultural techniques (a concept first employed in the 19th century in an agricultural context) to the changing intellectual constellation of postwar Germany. More specifically, it traces how the concept evolved from \textendash{} and reacted against \textendash{} so-called German media theory, a decidedly anti-hermeneutic and anti-humanist current of thought frequently associated with the work of Friedrich Kittler. Post-hermeneutic rather than anti-hermeneutic in its outlook, the reconceptualization of cultural techniques aims at presenting them as chains of operations that link humans, things, media and even animals. To investigate cultural techniques is to shift the analytic gaze from ontological distinctions to the ontic operations that gave rise to the former in the first place. As Siegert points out, this shift recalls certain concurrent developments within the North American posthumanities; the paper therefore also includes a discussion of the similarities and differences between German and North American posthumanism.},

  title = {Cultural {{Studies}} in {{Peru}}: {{An Experience From}} the {{Universidad Cat{\'o}lica}}},
  volume = {26},
  abstract = {The name Cultural Studies and its institutionalization in the university must not allow us to lose sight of the fact that reflection on culture is an old tradition, especially in a society like Peru's, so heterogeneous, conflictive and charged with history. The very fact of the convergence or clash of cultures in the sixteenth century fomented the consciousness that cultural uses and customs are not natural but must be understood in the light of history. Since the seventeenth century we have essays attempting to objectivize cultures and their (mis)understandings. These constitute a tradition of trying to imagine a viable society out of fragmentation. Garcilaso de la Vega and Huam{\'a}n Poma are the founders of this desire to comprehend the other and propose just ways of living together. In the nineteenth century this reflection deepens, since now the task is to constitute a nation. Many will think that homogenization around the creole identity is the path towards modernity. Others will feel that the past lives on and gives form to the present, necessarily complex and plural. This debate about the country takes place in literature and in cultural criticism, in the works of Mari{\'a}tegui, Arguedas, Vargas Llosa, Flores Galindo. This tradition is taken up by Cultural Studies which, as an academic activity is born of the dialogue between the humanities and the social sciences. It is a dialogue in which psychoanalysis functions to facilitate the encounter. This article emphasizes the immediate antecedents of the institutionalization of Cultural Studies and situates them within the framework of a necessary public intervention which characterizes this type of interdisciplinarity.},

It refers, however,only to the German reception of cultural studies and focuses on the different ways cultural studies have become influential in various contexts since the 1970s. Three major stages can, roughly, be detected. The first comes from a new Leftist background dealing with working class and youth culture, and the discussion of the notion 'ideology'. The second grew out of the youth culture debate in an attempt to re-politicize it, elaborated by the so-called 'German Pop left'. The third is now within academia, particularly in media studies and'Kulturwissenschaften'. The contribution aims to sketch out the limitations of the, however different, lines of the German reception of cultural studies as well as the weaknesses of the attempts to work in cultural studies with reference to what can be called the German (intellectual) tradition.},

  abstract = {This article presents an always risky cartography of the institutionalization of the field of Cultural Studies in Colombia in the 1990s. The article starts with a personal narration on how the author was introduced to this novel field by entering the first graduate programme in Cultural Studies in Colombia. Here, it locates the major tensions, stereotypes and loud silences characteristic of the social sciences in Colombia in which this institutionalization was infused and also threatened by the 1990s. But far from thinking that this recent event inaugurated an intellectual project thanks to the importation of theories and methodologies at this moment, the article describes previous intellectual traditions like the one influenced by the works of Orlando Fals Borda that had challenged positivist and neutral intellectual approaches to major problems in Colombia. Also, it highlights the influence that the work of Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero had through his paramount work on media and mediation since the 1970s. Afterwards, the article succinctly contextualizes the institutionalization of Cultural Studies in the 1990s through the emergence of the Ministry of Culture and the multicultural mantra and a whole scholarly and state's concern for cultural industries and culture policies. Finally, it describes the ?perverse confluences? between these new events and the arrival of neoliberal policies that had radically changed and challenged Colombian public and private universities. The article concludes with a contrasting image between a multiplication of interests, programmes, departments, conferences and publications in Cultural Studies in the larger universities in Colombia and their rampant transformation through the new scripts of audit cultures, indexation and the whole quantification of knowledge production.},

  title = {Cultural {{Studies}} as {{Labor}} of {{Negotiation}} in {{Higher Education}}},
  volume = {25},
  abstract = {This paper will focus on an applied research initiative we are currently engaged in, which brings together academics (both from conventional institutions \textendash{} the university, the research centers and undergraduate colleges \textendash{} and from 'new and innovative institutional structures') with policy-makers and grant-making organizations. The initiative has to do with the entire field of higher education (India having one of the biggest higher education systems in the world), but interestingly it was incubated by the Center for the Study of Culture and Society (CSCS). The painstaking process of the gestation of collaborative interdisciplinary themes/fields of research/teaching and the labor of negotiation with policy-makers and grantees in the field of higher education by a Cultural Studies centre is thus the focus of this paper. Called the Higher Education Cell, an important aspect of the initiative's genealogy is that it is based on (a) a critique of the existing disciplines and an attention to the birthing of 'new thematic/field specifics' as also (b) a critique of the research undertaken in mainstream institutions and an attention to new research methodologies. The Higher Education Cell is at present focusing on four major functions through which it plans to engage with the higher education sector. These functions are (i) Incubation of Research Initiatives, (ii) Institutional Collaborations, (iii) Documentation and Archiving, and (iv) Grant Development. The research initiatives, which include Globalization and Higher Education, General Education in Comparative Perspective, Regional Language Resources, and Social Justice in Higher Education, have been conceived through collaborations with a range of higher education institutions. The wider context of the labor of negotiation is one where (1) new institutional structures are being experimented with, resulting in the emergence of 'institutions with a difference', (2) new interdisciplinary courseware or new themes/fields of research/teaching are being created (such as film-media studies, gender-sexuality-Dalit studies, migration studies, environment studies) and (3) new research and pedagogic methodologies are being given shape.},

Retrieving the historical nexus questions views that treat and limit British cultural studies to being mainly an intellectual import-export phenomenon. The overlooked historical nexus fosters trivialization anad caricature of cultural studies' incorporation in the American academia, resulting in both conservative antipathy and left disappointments feeding into the common binary narratives of the 'failure' of cultural studies for being too Marxist and not Marxist enough. Restoring the historical nexus underscores the value of cultural formations and projects Williams proposed, while cautioning theoreticist and methodological enclosures.},

The intent of this essay is to push the understanding of the intellectual roots of media ecology toward a broader analysis of how media ecology is embedded in, and advocates for, the larger move in communication studies away from narrow, quantitative effects research and towards qualitative and interdisciplinary scholarship that is North American cultural studies.},

  volume = {51},
  abstract = {The heyday of classical film theory is predominantly understood to have been concerned with ontological and formal matters and with promoting film as an art. Pursuing the shapes and contours of the new medium, many writers on cinema from the 1920s heralded cinema as a 'universal language'. Examining the 'universal language' thesis, one finds a remarkable variety to the various arguments. By undertaking a close prospect of just one version of the 'universal language' thesis by a single writer, B{\'e}la Bal{\'a}zs, this essay intends to complicate the enterprise of 1920s 'classical film theory'. Tracing back the messy trail of reception and production and returning to the heart of Bal{\'a}zs's output, one finds a universal language which is neither truly universal, nor technically a language. Bal{\'a}zs's writings on cinema and language form the basis of a Janus-faced philosophy caught between future and past, film theory and human history, between an anthropology of the person and a prescription for various peoples. Re-examining Bal{\'a}zs and interrogating the 'universal language thesis' draws attention to the various modes, functions and addressees of what is called 'classical film theory' and to the need for new historiographical paradigms which take material matters of production and reception into account. At the same time, Bal{\'a}zs serves as an example for what unites many of the 1920s classical film theorists: the tension between the universal and the nationally specific and between their proposed theories and implied histories of film.},

  title = {Cultural {{Marxism}} in {{Postwar Britain}}: {{History}}, the {{New Left}}, and the {{Origins}} of {{Cultural Studies}}},

Tracing its development from beginnings in postwar Britain, through its various transformations in the 1960s and 1970s, to the emergence of British cultural studies at Birmingham, and up to the advent of Thatcherism, Dworkin shows this history to reflect a coherent intellectual tradition, one that represents an implicit and explicit theoretical effort to resolve the crisis of the postwar British Left. Limited to neither a single discipline nor a particular intellectual figure, this book comprehensively views British cultural Marxism in terms of the dialogue between historians and the originators of cultural studies and in its relationship to the new left and feminist movements. From the contributions of Eric Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, Sheila Rowbotham, Rodney Hilton, Catherine Hall, and E. P. Thompson to those of Perry Anderson, Barbara Taylor, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, and Dick Hebdidge, Dworkin examines the debates over issues of culture and society, structure and agency, experience and ideology, and theory and practice. The rise, demise, and reorganization of journals such as The Reasoner, The New Reasoner, Universities and Left Review, New Left Review, Past and Present are also part of the history told in this volume. In every instance, the focus of Dworkin's attention is the intellectual work seen in its political context. Capturing the excitement and commitment that more than one generation of historians, literary critics, art historians, philosophers, and cultural theorists have felt about an unorthodox and critical tradition ofMarxist theory, Cultural Marxism in Postwar Britain will appeal to students and scholars of cultural studies as well as those interested in the broader terrain of Marxist theory and contemporary critical theory.},

  isbn = {0-8122-4395-1},
  abstract = {How is it that American intellectuals, who had for 150 years worried about the deleterious effects of affluence, more recently began to emphasize pleasure, playfulness, and symbolic exchange as the essence of a vibrant consumer culture? The New York intellectuals of the 1930s rejected any serious or analytical discussion, let alone appreciation, of popular culture, which they viewed as morally questionable. Beginning in the 1950s, however, new perspectives emerged outside and within the United States that challenged this dominant thinking. Consuming Pleasures reveals how a group of writers shifted attention from condemnation to critical appreciation, critiqued cultural hierarchies and moralistic approaches, and explored the symbolic processes by which individuals and groups communicate. Historian Daniel Horowitz traces the emergence of these new perspectives through a series of intellectual biographies. With writers and readers from the United States at the center, the story begins in Western Europe in the early 1950s and ends in the early 1970s, when American intellectuals increasingly appreciated the rich inventiveness of popular culture. Drawing on sources both familiar and newly discovered, this transnational intellectual history plays familiar works off each other in fresh ways. Among those whose work is featured are J{\"u}rgen Habermas, Roland Barthes, Umberto Eco, Walter Benjamin, C. L. R. James, David Riesman and Marshall McLuhan, Richard Hoggart, members of London's Independent Group, Stuart Hall, Paddy Whannel, Tom Wolfe, Herbert Gans, Susan Sontag, Reyner Banham, and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.},

  title = {Constructing {{Mexico}}'s {{Media}}: {{A Critical Analysis}} of {{United States Mass Communication Research}}, 1945-1994},
  abstract = {Through surveying the literature on Mexican mass media published in American academic journals and books from 1945 to 1994, and the published literature in Mexico by Mexican researchers during the same period, this thesis assesses the influence of U.S. mass communication research ideologies and posits that Western scholars, mostly Americans, approach the study of Mexican mass media according to Western social, political, and cultural values. In general, traditional American social science methodologies, in particular, mass communication research, dominate Mexican mass media studies. Specifically, American scholars have tended to direct their analysis to the free expression of newspapers. This study found that most Americans in this field have limited themselves to judging the entirety of Mexican mass media from an American cultural viewpoint. In support of this conclusion, critical researchers have linked the problem of exporting 'alien' methods of study to Mexico and of bypassing or ignoring the social, cultural, and political realities of Mexico and other Latin American countries. This thesis shows how traditional American international media research conceives the Mexican media system from an American cultural perspective, thereby introducing a conceptualization of culture that implies the context of a free market of ideas in a free market economy. Still, based on a Cultural studies perspective, as posited by Stuart Hall and others, this study shows that by framing research questions based on Mexico's social, economic, and political realities (for instance, a dependent, capitalist society as opposed to an advanced, capitalist one), ethnocentric biases are avoided. The main question this thesis studies is: What approach have American scholars taken in their analysis of Mexican mass media? Findings of the research confirm the common complaint that the bulk of research carried out by American mass media scholars on Latin America has lacked sensitivity toward its cultural values, political systems, and economic conditions. Similarly, this study found that much of the media research in Mexico carried out by Mexican scholars followed lines of inquiry, theories, and methodologies proposed by Western researchers. Finally, this research shows that lack of indigenous research accounts for the theoretical dependency of Mexican scholarly works.},

The article evaluates the coherence of our fragmented discipline through the articulation of the categories of the One and the Multiple in ontological and epistemological directions. In doing so, the recurrent conception of communication studies as an interdiscipline is criticized while recognizing the importance of undertaking interdisciplinary research within the field. Are especially considered the historical roots of interdisciplinary advocacies, namely the institutional demands for interdisciplinarity that have often resulted in conceptions of communication studies by communication scholars themselves as a crossroads or a service discipline. Building from Ernst Cassirer's developments regarding the '' theory of the concept'', the author contends in the final section of the paper that the solution to the lack of coherence of the field lies in the necessity for communication studies to discipline themselves in order for the research undertaken within the field to acquire a common framework of intelligibility.},

This, I argue, is what Innis accomplished. His early studies of Canadian economic history transcended conventional economics and laid the groundwork for a later political theory of communications. It expressly took up the 1946 challenge to address competing monopolies of knowledge and power, hence manipulating the space and time-binding properties of communications media. Innis' work reflected a materialist model of communications, a social ecology, a soft determinism or philosophic naturalism and it linked knowledge, freedom and power. Finally, I conclude, these insights permitted Innis to transcend bias and to search for a balanced culture.},

  abstract = {This dissertation presents the philosophical debate about the growth of scientific knowledge and an analysis of the progress and degeneration of the scientific activity in the area of the uses and effects of mass communication. The first chapter of the dissertation surveys the history of the philosophical debate about the growth of scientific knowledge starting from the 1920's - 1930's with the logical-positivists, continuing with Kuhn's (1962) and Popper's (1963) analyses until Lakatos' (1970), The Methodology of Scientific Research Programs. This chapter concludes that Lakatos' Methodology incorporates Popper's criticism of logical-positivism and shows and supersedes the limitations faced by Popper's and Kuhn's works. The second chapter concludes that logical-positivism and Kuhn's (1962) model of scientific change are still very influential in the appraisal of mass communication research. Also, falsificationism is presented as a useful alternative to assess the scientific growth in this area as shown by the analysis of the Berelson-Schramm-Riesman-Bauer (1959) debate of the status of mass media research at the time. The third chapter presents the five research programs competing in the area of mass communication research. The fourth chapter gives a detailed account of uses and gratifications research in light of Lakatos' Methodology. The chapter specifies the progress and degeneration presented in uses and gratifications research. Later, the major theoretical and methodological problems facing the area and the attempts to solve them are mentioned. Finally, the present dissertation concludes that Lakatos' Methodology was successful in offering an alternative way to look at and evaluate the scientific works in the study of the uses and effects of the mass media and stresses the need to conduct more analyses of this kind to further assess the validity of Lakatos' (1970) model of scientific knowledge growth.},

At one time, the study of speech communication in this country largely focused on the development of one's voice toward an expanded appreciation of the '' noble pleasures'' of speaking. Through a series of epistemic transformations, the study of speech no longer directly concerns matters of oral performance and bodily gesture; instead, it has taken on the agenda of a social science discipline and has tended to de-emphasize the significance of the body in human communication systems, concentrating instead on language (langue) systems, ideologies, and communication technologies. The implication of the subdued role of the human body in the process of verbal performance provides the central problem for this essay\textemdash{}becoming thematic in the genealogy of speech communication studies (namely, the series of choices to elevate the discussion of speech communication subject matters over and above the experience and pleasure of the speaking subject).

What mainly explains the field's disciplinary emergence is its significant relationship to communication as a category of social practice, and it is, I argue, by reconstructing its intellectual traditions around that category that the field can best hope not only to become more intellectually coherent and productive but more useful to society as well. A theory of disciplinarity is presented in which every discipline derives its identity and coherence from its participation in the conversation of disciplines, for which it draws on a specific mixture of intellectual, institutional, and sociocultural discursive resources. Communication's specific character as a discipline thus can be understood in terms of its contributions to knowledge in certain intellectual traditions, its evolving institutional forms, and its relevance to '' communication'' understood as a socioculturally constituted category of problems and practices. The third of these factors \textemdash{} the sociocultural context of disciplinarity \textemdash{} has, I maintain, a primary role. Communication as a practical discipline has been constructed upon (even as it reflexively reconstructs) the foundation of communication as an increasingly central category in modern societies and global culture.},

The discipline in South Africa, presents a very exciting and intriguing posture for the simple fact that it allows for diversity\textendash{} observable in the variety of labels, emphases and curricula. Equally enviable is the currency of some aspects of the programmes offered in the country and the strong theoretical foundation of research publications. Yet some deficiencies observed in a number of the curricula provoke a call for standardization of programmes offered by the various universities. The lack of regulation could be held responsible for some lapses noticeable in the structure of the various programmes. Drawing on observations of South Africa's communication and media education landscape, this article argues that the field seems to be withdrawn and too inward-looking that is evidenced by the lack of interest in the affairs of the African Council for Communication Education (ACCE) and what used to be the predominantly locally oriented content of South African journals. Thus, South African academia is tactically excluded from the leadership which it should provide on the African continent. Some cross-references are made to the situation in Nigeria, being the country where the writer had been involved in communication and media scholarship before moving to South Africa.},

Data are gathered on two dimensions of the research question: (1) We quantify the number of public interest advocacy groups focused on CIP in the United States from 1961 to the present, using organizational ecology methods. (2) We track the number of U.S. Congressional hearings held each year on CIP issues. The results show that CIP now exceeds other social movement issues (women, civil rights, the environment, human rights) as a major concern of Congressional activity, that the issues are becoming more interdependent, and that modes of citizens advocacy have undergone drastic changes in recent years.},

Many of the questions raised concerning this issue were similar to those asked later during the age of television. Relying heavily upon the psychoanalytic emphasis on emotion, catharsis, and intrapsychic dynamics, expert opinion voiced in various popular periodicals and newspapers of the day suggested that the violence and excitement portrayed in many of the crime and adventure programs was harmless, and perhaps beneficial, for most listeners. However, research in support of this conclusion was sparse, and psychologists evidenced little interest in the issue. Not until the advent of television, and the emergence of social learning theory in the early 1960s, did psychologists direct significant research effort towards evaluating the effects of media violence.},

The work includes studies of content, effects, and policy, and offers research conducted by social scientists and cultural studies scholars. The research questions represented here consider the content of programming, children's responses to television, regulation concerning children's television policies, issues of advertising, and concerns about sex and race stereotyping, often voicing concerns that children's entertainment be held to a higher standard. The volume also offers essays by scholars who have been seeking answers to some of the most critical questions addressed by this research. It represents the interdisciplinary nature of research on children and television, and draws on many academic traditions, including communication studies, psychology, sociology, education, economics, and medicine. The full bibliography is included on CD. Arguably the most comprehensive bibliography of research on children and television, this work illustrates the ongoing evolution of scholarship in this area, and establishes how it informs or changes public policy, as well as defining its role in shaping a future agenda.

Surveying the research on children and television, the author found that many different actors having economic and political stakes in the issue are active in the policy debate. Proponents as well as opponents of television advertising aimed at children have initiated and financed studies, the results of which often serve their respective interests. The fact that a majority of the studies on this subject have been steered by extra-scientific interests (e.g., the policy decision of whether advertising to young children should be banned or regulated) means that the studies have had different starting points and perspectives. Thus, it is found that those favoring television advertising aimed at children prefer to cite research based on observations, the results of which indicate that even very young children can recognize and comprehend commercial messages. On the other hand, opponents of such advertising tend to cite findings based on verbal responses that show that only after some years can children distinguish commercials from other program content and perceive their intent.},

Finally, his continuing contributions far beyond the above six areas are documented in terms of the authors' own long-time endeavors in scientific research in intra- and inter-cultural communications theories, analytic methodologies, and contemporary substantive social issues, ranging from conflicts, adult intimate relationships, to youth communications and developments.

  abstract = {This study was conducted to clarify the debate in the United States between the neo-Marxist and the reflective perspectives on the social role of modern mass advertising. It was set in the context of controversies which surfaced in 'Ferment in the Field' and 'Paradigm Dialogues' debates over various theoretical approaches in communication studies, including the debate over critical vs. empirical research. The study was designed to foster better understanding of the nature of the debate between the two perspectives on mass, national advertising as a first step toward possible resolution. Works by eight authors representing the two perspectives were examined. These authors included Stuart Ewen, Jules Henry, Michael Parenti, and Herbert I. Schiller for the neo-Marxist perspective and Ronald Berman, Stephen Fox, Roland Marchand, and Michael Schudson for the reflective perspective. The study compared and analyzed the agreement and disagreement between the two perspectives in six areas: (1) their interpretations of advertising; (2) their research concerns; (3) their theoretical assumptions; (4) the evidence they used to support their arguments or to arrive at their interpretations; (5) their research methods; and (6) the methods they used to verify their findings. The study concluded that, except for a few basic similarities, the two perspectives differed in most of the categories examined. These categories included the two perspectives' conceptions, assumptions, and arguments about the interrelationship between modern advertising (as a social institution, as a form of artistic expression, and as a marketing tool) and the rise of a consumer culture and mass consumption in the context of advanced capitalism or market economy. Except for detailed footnotes or endnotes and bibliographical data, no other standard, formal verification method or mechanism proposed or used by scholars from the two perspectives were found. The study concluded that no mutually agreed-upon criteria could be used to verify or refute the arguments put forth by the two perspectives. It was suggested that a genuine resolution of the debate between the two perspectives appeared to be remote.},

  title = {British {{Cultural Studies}}, {{Active Audiences}} and the {{Status}} of {{Cultural Theory}}},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {British cultural studies, represented perhaps chiefly by the so-called Birmingham School, is much marked by its strong orientation towards the application of grounded theory in the analysis of concrete cases, rather than the development of abstract Theory with a Capital T (in Stuart Hall's words). As a leading figure of the Birmingham School and a key representative of the active audience model in television studies, or broadly, media studies, David Morley stands at a point where this trend was set, as is evidenced in this interview. Questioned by Huimin Jin, Morley puts his audience studies into the contexts of British cultural studies, postmodernism, Marxism, social movements, and so on; and in doing so, he shows the ambiguity, and subtlety of his concepts of how to best theorize the active audience. Only by this method, Jin believes, could Morley launch his version of audience studies, which aims not to invent a general theory of media effects, but to use an interdisciplinary range of theories to explore how people actually respond to a TV programme; and only by this approach to audience studies, furthermore, could Morley develop a theory of the audience's activity, which is embedded in the course of their everyday life and that cannot be thoroughly colonized by discourses. Cultural studies, wherever it is conducted, therefore, Morley suggests, has to construct modes of analysis that are relevant to its own conditions of production in a particular place, at a particular time. This is the tradition, as we know it, but also the future, as Morley envisages, of cultural studies.},

  volume = {30},
  abstract = {This article argues that the mid-1960s saw a dramatic shift in how 'brainwashing' was popularly imagined, reflecting Anglo-American developments in the sciences of mind as well as shifts in mass media culture. The 1965 British film The Ipcress File (dir. Sidney J. Furie, starr. Michael Caine) provides a rich case for exploring these interconnections between mind control, mind science and media, as it exemplifies the era's innovations for depicting 'brainwashing' on screen: the film's protagonist is subjected to flashing lights and electronic music, pulsating to the 'rhythm of brainwaves'. This article describes the making of The Ipcress File's brainwashing sequence and shows how its quest for cinematic spectacle drew on developments in cybernetic science, multimedia design and modernist architecture (developments that were also influencing the 1960s psychedelic counter-culture). I argue that often interposed between the disparate endeavours of 1960s mind control, psychological science and media was a vision of the human mind as a 'cybernetic spectator': a subject who scrutinizes how media and other demands on her sensory perception can affect consciousness, and seeks to consciously participate in this mental conditioning and guide its effects.},

Employing aspects of Hall's method of 'conjunctural analysis', the article argues that, although known for its anti-essentialism, Black British arts of the 1980s and early 1990s constituted a contradictory formation \textendash{} including a strong Afrocentric, essentialist trajectory that remained largely immune to Hall's ideas.},

This article explicates and assesses Debord's theory. Its most serious defect is Debord's rejection of the necessary intermediation of social life by culture and communication. Furthermore, his analysis subscribes to the trope of mass society, which sees the populace as culturally denuded, divorced from community and subject to the imposition of false needs. Against this alienated world, Debord pits the ideal of a collective revolutionary subject that freely creates society. However, both terms \textendash{} alienated masses and revolutionary collective \textendash{} are implicitly dependent upon liberal individualism, which abstracts individuals from the cultural traditions and social relations in which they are embedded.},

In the article he outlines the difficulties and the solutions to obtaining reliable information about audiences in communist parts of Europe during that period and in the previous years before he was responsible. He shows how the internal political outlook and atmosphere at Bush House coloured the approaches that were taken. He shows how audience research for all the BBC's external broadcasting was developed from the early days and what was done after the Second World War when Soviet control over large areas of Central and Eastern Europe effectively closed many target area countries to any internal research. There was heavy reliance on anecdotal evidence, the few listeners' letters that were received and interviews with refugees leaving communist countries. But then new methods were developed, principally by the US government funded broadcasters, Radio Liberty and Radio Free Europe. They developed an extensive approach which contacted travellers from communist countries when they were travelling outside the communist areas and these produced a wealth of information about listening to western broadcasters. There was close cooperation between the audience research department at the BBC and the respective departments at RL and RFE. When the Berlin Wall came down and communist rule ended in all of Europe, research inside the country became possible. Some was actually possible and conducted even earlier in Poland and Yugoslavia. The surveys in country at the end of communism showed that earlier estimates based on interviewing travellers had been remarkably accurate.},

This article explores the origins of this theme, the different discourses and definitions in play, and the roles of the various agents involved.

Psychologists warn us of the dangers of "celebrity worship," sociologists interrogate young people about their personal expectations of fame, and even a discipline with as attenuated a relation to popular culture as literary studies now studies such things as ?post-colonial celebrity?. The textual richness of celebrity culture is proving irresistible, and so the fetish for textual analysis that dominated so much of the 1980s has found itself right at home in the study of celebrity. But is this what we want from the study of celebrity? What are the approaches that are most needed, and which are likely to be the most productive for those of us in cultural and media studies for whom celebrity has become part of the heartland for the study of popular culture? This article will discuss some of the options, and in particular it will ask how we might establish a stronger base for the study of the industrial production, as well as the audience consumption, of celebrity.},

  abstract = {This article describes a particular academic situation in which the authors organized a Cultural Studies programme in a specific place: the city of Rosario in Argentina. Our programme attempts to free itself from the curricular malaise provoked by the disconnect between the university and society and at the same time, it is the product of a paradoxical situation. Many who claim to do Cultural Studies rarely cross the borders of their own discipline, nor do they lend themselves to interdisciplinary dialogue. In the face of this, we proceed from the need to attend to the specific forms of contextualization in which knowledge is produced. We hew to a local logic in formulating the objectives of our programme. Still, this locality does not mean that we forget about global frameworks and transnational spaces and their determining effects. Rosario is a peripheral city whose identity is based not on being a central megalopolis (like Buenos Aires), but on regional and even transnational relations with other cities: Porto Alegre, Montevideo, Curitiba. This experience has led to the formulation of a cultural strategy notable for giving impulse to inclusive institutional forms and innovative cultural policies. We do Cultural Studies hoping to foment a critical look from our region, to contribute to the formation of agents that can act dynamically in our contemporaneity, not only to understand but to be involved in our social processes.},

Using Michael Hardt and Toni Negri's concept of the '' multitude,'' the author argues that the audience is a product of discursive constructions, but that these constructions themselves draw upon the ontological practices of what may be called '' audience powers'' or '' mediated multitudes.'' Problematizations of the audience in communication studies are examples of what Negri calls '' constituted power,'' as they seek to capture conceptually the immanent practices of audience constituent powers. Concentrating on 3 early audience discourses (propaganda, marketing, and moral panics), the author assesses how audience power provoked these problematizations and argues that an ontology of media subjects and audience powers offers new perspectives on audiences and audience studies},

It interested him, so he looked into some of the procedures and what he could learn about it. The first thing that stopped him was that the sample selection appeared to him to be rather naive. A so-called quota sample was used at this time, which was based on the assumption that if one stratifies his sample on a few known characteristics, then the unknown for which he makes the study automatically comes out right. Answering to a question as to what he would advise a person who wants to enter the research field professionally, he said that, he would suggest him to study some mathematical statistics and some experimental psychology, because experimental psychology still employed strictly scientific rules. Experimentation required rigid rules, whereas much of psychology was void of experimental need. Thus a psychologist could arrive at something as an opinion because it's his opinion without any further foundation.},

The case is the author's home base at the University of Oslo. Units and networks of media and communication research are analyzed as 'activity systems'.

  volume = {4},
  abstract = {After years of heated controversy over philosophical orientations among communication researchers, a consensus seems to have emerged that recognizes the value of both the American and Europeans traditions. It was in the wake of the 'ferment' debates among communication scholars in the late 1970s and early 1980s that African communication scholars also started to take stock of their field and take a closer look at their historical and cultural experiences. In trying to situate their own unique perspectives within the study of communication, these scholars lamented the paucity of authentic African theoretical perspectives. All human communication behaviour is grounded in culture. Hence, authentic African communication theories attempt to explain such behaviour from the African cultural context. Over the years, however, African communication researchers engaged more in 'reactive scholarship' than in original theory building and relied largely on Eurocentric theories to explain African realities. Our study seeks to assess what progress has been made towards theory building among African communication scholars, and to determine whether such efforts still remain largely 'reactive', consist-ing mainly of criticisms of Eurocentric models and theories. The data revealed that after 30 years of debate on the ferment in communication research, there is still a gaping hole in African communication research, one that is devoid of authentic African communication theories that reflect the cultural, linguis-tic and social cleavages of the African society.},

The conditions of possibility of the said institutionalization are ascribed to something like a crisis, itself engendered by the encroachment of neoliberal ideology on the University's sense of mission and understanding of itself. Essentially, a more or less traditional department of modern languages was abolished and a potentially innovative but epistemologically fuzzy department devoted to teaching language and the linguistic turn, each informed by the other, was cobbled together in its place. This required the re-tooling of the department's professors, but also the hiring of new professors who influenced the department's intellectual direction and contributed to the sharpening of the project. The article then describes how the incipient programme was the site of a struggle for epistemological clarity, which is here represented in the form of an argument about the necessity of thinking both Foucault and Marx together in the project of critical Cultural Studies.},

The discussion is grounded in some historical background, including a brief sketch of some of the history of critical communications research in the US, which flourished within the global profusion of critical research in the 1960s and 1970s. Part of this history is the emergence of organisational support for critical scholarship as well as the long-term employment of individual scholars by specific universities that made critical classes part of both graduate and undergraduate curricula. That process of institutionalisation provided the basis for the next generations of critical scholars from the 1980s through the present \textendash{} generations whose research address a broad range of communications phenomena, use a wide range of research methods, and draw from a wide array of critical theories. This overview sets the stage for a critique of the current attack on radical political economy specifically. That attack is considered in terms of two key texts that caricature political economic research as an enterprise dependent on theories imported from the Frankfurt School, limited to a macroscopic approach, only interested in journalism, and ignoring both media workers and media audiences.},

But it is precisely this implosion that has an intoxicating effect, which paves the way for a more political, or at least politicized, reading of Kittler's work that highlights his indebtedness to the cultural transgressions of the 1960s.},

  title = {Imaginative {{Resistance}}: {{The Rise}} of {{Cultural Studies}} as {{Political Practice}} in {{Britain}}},
  abstract = {Cultural studies has by now become largely institutionalized as an influential approach to theorizing and studying the mass media. However, most accounts of cultural studies' conflicted origins tend to be superficial or overly simplistic. This dissertation seeks to rectify that situation by offering an in-depth intellectual history of the early development of cultural studies as it evolved in Britain, with special attention to the significance of developments in cultural studies for media studies. The emphasis is upon the rise of cultural studies as a self-conscious political project heavily grounded in ideal modes of resistance. The study focuses on both the biographies and influences of cultural studies' main 'founders' and disseminators, including Richard Hoggart, Raymond Williams, E.P. Thompson and Stuart Hall, as well as the social, political and economic contexts within which their ideas took shape. The stress is upon the dialectic between conditions and consciousness in the formation of new ideas about culture. The study strives to explain, in empirical detail, how such ideas coalesced, diverged and spread. It examines influences upon cultural studies from Romanticism; literary criticism, especially the work of F.R. Leavis; the adult education movement; and the British New Left, stressing throughout the way in which the imagination is called to the fore in the struggle to resist the negative impacts of capitalist modernity. A detailed description of the founding of the Birmingham Center for Contemporary Cultural Studies is included, with special attention paid to the transition in the 1960s from 'socialist humanist' concerns to a more abstract theoretical orientation, exemplified initially in the embrace of structuralism and later post-structuralist theory. The thesis concludes with the argument that while cultural studies historically and appropriately seeks to offer a non-reductionist approach to culture, stressing the mutually determining matrix of relationships between the material and the ideal, much of its political potential as an intellectual project has been attenuated through too much neglect of actual material circumstances. If cultural studies is to realize its value for media research in particular, scholars in the field must strike a better balance between the study of the production, dissemination and reception of cultural products.},

  abstract = {Until recent years, historians of twentieth-century Britain have made relatively little use of the popular press as a source. This is partly due to the practical problems of working with newspapers (pre-digitisation); there has also been, however, a widespread perception that popular journalism is predictable, trivial and politically and socially conservative, and therefore not worthy of sustained scholarly attention. These attitudes are starting to change, encouraged by the process of digitisation. Nevertheless, substantial gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of the press. This article is in two sections; the first examines how popular national newspapers have been used in political narratives, and the second explores their place in discussions of social and cultural change.

There, American communication studies well before the twentieth century drew to a close knew of its label, 'symbolic interactionism,' but its perspective and sensibility were largely forgotten, at least twice during the century. Duncan's thesis of communication and social order was not generally recognised for its sustained effort to bring the study of authority, hierarchy, and power into the centre of communicative interaction. A way to develop a communication theory of society, Duncan's work became a critique of communication research in the wake of the forgotten tradition he attempted to resurrect. The field had conceptually forsaken the idea of communication to disconnected concepts, for which Duncan equally faulted seminal European scholars who, nevertheless, offered the best explanations for the ordering of society until the arrival of symbolic interactionism and its cousin, philosophical pragmatism. This essay highlights Duncan's communication theory as a theory of society, and proposes a critical appropriation of this alternative in the history of ideas, one that warns of assumptions risked whenever communication is theorised without and with attention to power.},

The policy of appeasing Hitler and the non-partisan stance of the Labour Party in the face of the Spanish Civil War made the Communist Party an attractive alternative. From this generation emerged key figures in academia and publishing: Eric Hobsbawm, Ralph Miliband, John Saville, Martin Eve, Dorothy and Edward Thompson, and Raymond Williams. Woodhams studies the experiences of this generation, the motives which attracted them towards the CPGB, and their reactions to and experiences in the Second World War. He examines what opportunities were open to them in the post-war years and their influence particularly in the field of adult education. He argues that Raymond Williams anticipated some of the thinking of the new left, especially in the field of cultural studies. But in the shadow of the1956 events in Hungary another new left emerged drawing on post-war experiences and circumstances. This collective biography throws a new light on the continuities and breaks in British political and intellectual history. It challenges conventional periodization separating pre- and post-war history and questions the sources of continuity and change in Britain.},

The second addresses the need to distinguish history as a discipline from a wider range of approaches that grasp the 'historicity' or 'temporality' of human life. The work of the hermeneutic philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, helps to identify this difference and engages with the double character of historical work: part empirical study, part 'fiction'. The article itself can be read as a narrative about history and cultural studies \textendash{} a story of debts and differences, polemics and splits, convergences and renewed dialogue.

A marketing guy really is a guy who basically would like to have his own business and, all too often because circumstances are such, cannot have it. And it seems to him that the big contribution that marketing research people make is to be marketing guides to people who have marketing jobs.

  volume = {15},
  abstract = {What is metal studies? How can we define and characterize it? How has it emerged as a body of academic enquiry? What are its dominant disciplinary strands, theoretical concepts and preferred methodologies? Which studies have claimed most attention, defined the goals of scholarship, typical research strategies and values? How has the claim for the legitimacy or symbolic value of metal scholarship been achieved (if it has): over time and through gradual acceptance or through conflict and contestation? How can this process of formation, or strategy of legitimation, be mapped, examined and interrogated and which methods of historical, institutional and cultural analysis are best suited to this task? Working with the most complete bibliography to date of published research on heavy metal, music and culture (the MSBD), this article employs Foucault's archaeological "method" to examine the institutional, cultural and political contexts and conflicts that inform the genealogy of this scholarship. Such analysis reveals a formative, largely negative account of heavy metal to be found in the "sociology of rock"; a large volume of psychology work, examining heavy metal music preference as an indicator of youth risk, deviance and delinquency; sociological work on youth and deviancy critical of the values of this research and its links to social policy and politics; culminating in the work of Weinstein and Walser, who advocate a perspective sympathetic to the values of heavy metal fans themselves. Following Bourdieu, I interpret such symbolic strategies as claims for expertise within the academic field that are high or low in symbolic capital to the extent they can attain disciplinary autonomy. I then go on to examine the most recent strands of research, within cultural studies and ethnomusicology, concerned with the global metal music diaspora, and consider to what extent such work is constitutive of a coherent subfield of metal studies that can be distinguished from earlier work and what the implications of this might be.},

One thinks of the introduction of Antonio Gramsci's writings to IR theorists by Robert Cox, for example, and the 'school' that has developed in its wake. Similarly, the works of Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, and Jurgen Habermas are all relatively familiar to most IR theorists not because of their writings on world politics per se, but because they were imported into the field by roving theorists. Many others of varying success could be cited as well. Such cross-disciplinary excursions are important because they inject vitality into a field that \textendash{} in the opinion of some at least\textemdash{}is in need of rejuvenation in the face of contemporary changes. In this paper, I elaborate on the work of the Canadian communications theorist Harold Innis, situating his work within contemporary IR theory while underlining his historicism, holism, and attention to time-space biases.},

Answering to a question on the present condition of advertising research Ziesel said that, now research has spread enormously in many ways it has shifted from the agency and the media to the manufacturers. The agencies concentrate more and more on what is called creative research following the bifurcation that began with idea of separating the creative work from the bulk of administrative and mechanical work. He thinks research has followed it. The shift away from the agencies was facilitated by a perennial headache namely, the problem of billing research from the agency. Every so often the agency had to absorb these costs, so the development was really by mutual agreement, toward the manufacturer taking charge of his own research. On asking Ziesel about the legal side of his activities, Ziesel said that his work during the last 20 years at the University of Chicago Law School, was making lawyers aware that there is more to law than only study, constitutions, court decisions, and statutes.},

At the turn of the twenty-first century, we must recognize that it was the underlying long-term trend of individualization, and its associated trends of consumerism, globalization, and democratization, that, historically and now, more profoundly frame the place of television in the family.},

Both investigations were affiliated to the Princeton-Columbia workshop; both were connected with P. F. Lazarsfeld's personality; both showed the influence of radio broadcasting to be socially differentiated and conditioned; both researches were joined with the war, which interfered in them as a factor of motivation; both used ''focused interviews'' and similar procedures and verified their results by surveys; both projects belonged to the class of ''Firehouse Research'' demanding, contrary to expectations, collection of data immediately after the event. The paper acquaints readers with the questions, methods and results of both investigations. It shows and emphasises the combined use of different methods with the unique intent of problem-understanding and positively evaluates the look to the workshop, which both publications offer.},

Statistical data can mislead, however, when numbers are reported without careful attention to the shifting classification schemes that underlie them. The work that is needed in order to understand the recent emergence of a communication discipline is at least as much theoretical and interpretive as it is empirical. To illustrate this point, we explore two types of indicators of growth and transformation of communication studies: statistics on degrees granted and trends in the classification of books and serials. For each type of indicator we show that the emergence of communication as a category has involved qualitative transformation of the category itself as well as quantitative growth within the category. This categorical transformation, and its deeper roots in the evolution of communication as a cultural practice, will be basic to any adequate interpretation of our discipline's increasing centrality in academe and in society.},

At the turn of the 21st century, Kittler champions an emphatic notion of culture as a necessary supplement to science and technology. This conceptual marriage mediates grand historical narratives of cultural identity. Specifically, Kittler's texts provide us with narratives of Greek origin which serve to re-capture collective identities in the age of globalization. On the explicit level, this identity is predominantly European, but the search has national components as well. With his turn to culture, the organizing trope of 19th-century German nationalism, Kittler has also embraced the legacy of German philhellenism, which articulated national identities through the theme of 'elective affinity'. Kittler's Greece occupies the very structural place it had in 19th-century German philhellenism: It stands in for both the foundation of European civilization and its virtual better self, a realm of sensual culture untainted by modern capitalism and Empire. Most of the figures inhabiting this realm are familiar from 19th-century discourse as well, but these discursive loops are fueled by contemporary feedback. Kittler's Greek narratives have developed out of postwar academic discourses and connect to other post-unification Greek fantasies.},

George Gallup's polling techniques first achieved fame when he accurately predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would be reelected president in 1936. Gallup had devised an extremely effective sampling method that took households from all income brackets into account, and Hollywood studio executives quickly pounced on the value of Gallup's research. Soon he was gauging reactions to stars and scripts for RKO Pictures, David O. Selznick, and Walt Disney and taking the public's temperature on Orson Welles and Desi Arnaz, couples such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and films like Gone with the Wind, Dumbo, and Fantasia. Through interviews and extensive research, Susan Ohmer traces Gallup's groundbreaking intellectual and methodological developments, examining his comprehensive approach to market research from his early education in the advertising industry to his later work in Hollywood. The results of his opinion polls offer a fascinating glimpse at the class and gender differences of the time as well as popular sentiment toward social and political issues.},

Many of our recent self-descriptions and theory formations are coined by our media-technological condition. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of Niklas Luhmann, especially in his inherent narrative of the history of rationality. This essay attempts to reconstruct Luhmann's redescription of European rationality, especially the media- and machine-historical conditions that remain apparent in Luhmann's account. The decisive issue is that Luhmann's history of rationality reveals the technological unconscious of systems theory and indeed the epochal imaginary it belongs to. With the help of the theories of machines developed by von Foerster, Simondon and G{\"u}nther, Luhmann's oeuvre must be read as probably the most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what could be called the 20th-century's epochal technological shift of meaning.},

Showing a singular intellectual honesty, Ludovico Silva worked on a general theory of ideology, challenging the official Marxism and leftist political forces of the age. Based on Marx\textasciiacute{}s difference between use value and exchange value, Silva argued that the Marxist category of surplus needed an equivalent in the symbolic realm; hence he developed the concept of ideological surplus in order to reject mechanical interpretations of ideology. Thus, Silva, among other scholars, contributed to Latin American communication studies by incorporating power and domination as structural forces in the making of social relations. The ideological power of media became the ultimate concern in media studies, questioning the explanatory value of the functionalist and quantitative studies focused on media effects, which were dominant at that time. Silva\textasciiacute{}s work is recovered here in a historical perspective, stressing his intellectual commitment to the truth, and his contribution to move Latin American communication studies from a conventional academic stance to a critical one.},

  abstract = {Moving world-systems analysis into the cultural realm, Richard E. Lee locates the cultural studies movement within a broad historical and geopolitical framework. He illuminates how order and conflict have been reflected and negotiated in the sphere of knowledge production by situating the emergence of cultural studies at the intersection of post\textendash{}1945 international and British politics and a two-hundred-year history of conservative critical practice. Tracing British criticism from the period of the French Revolution through the 1960s, he describes how cultural studies in its infancy recombined the elite literary critical tradition with the First New Left's concerns for history and popular culture\textemdash{}just as the liberal consensus began to come apart. Lee tracks the intellectual project of cultural studies as it developed over three decades, beginning with its institutional foundation at the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS). He links work at the CCCS to the events of 1968 and explores cultural studies' engagement with theory in the debates on structuralism. He considers the shift within the discipline away from issues of working-class culture toward questions of identity politics in the fields of race and gender. He follows the expansion of the cultural studies project from Britain to Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. Contextualizing the development and spread of cultural studies within the longue dur{\'e}e structures of knowledge in the modern world-system, Lee assesses its past and future as an agent of political and social change.},

  abstract = {With the rise of the democratic state came a strong emphasis on "the public" or "public opinion" in the study of politics. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of important works examined the contours of public opinion within a democracy. The study of public opinion since this early period has only intensified. However, recent work on public opinion is problematic: the theoretical and normative concerns and the political / sociological focus of the early works on public opinion are largely missing. Most modern studies of public opinion are psychologically driven and often truncated from broad concerns of American politics and democratic theory. In this article, I explicate the history of public opinion research, paying particular attention to the "early" works and how their concerns and emphases have been neglected by many "later" studies of public opinion. Through this history I aim to highlight the differences between the early and later phases and to suggest that much was lost in neglecting the concerns of the early writers on public opinion. While some contemporary researchers are, in fact, harking back to the early work, I conclude that a more thorough re-acquaintance with the classics of public opinion is necessary.},

R.) Leavis (1895\textendash{}1978). Who was Matthew Arnold? F. R. Leavis? What were the conditions of possibility of their work and words \textendash{} that is, for the practices and positions for which they advocated? What new questions might emerge by sharing in detailed and perhaps unexpected stories of individuals who, presently, seem to function in Cultural Studies mainly as known-unknowns? The argument is that the details of both Arnold and Leavis' lives are integral to understanding the conditions of possibility of their work, both individually and collectively, and indeed to more fully appreciating the meaning and implications their work holds for Cultural Studies.

The paper provides a literature overview for showing that, and how, Marxian concepts have been used in Internet Studies.

  volume = {63},
  abstract = {James C. McCroskey's contributions to instructional communication can best be summarized by tracing his influence on what academics read in the scholarly journals, what they learned through his leadership roles with coauthorship collaborations and mentoring and within academic associations, and his research work shaping several areas within the discipline, particularly classroom excellence. One's legacy in part is determined by what one does and who one influences, but a scholar's legacy more profoundly is determined by how one's actions make a significant, undeniable impact on the trajectory of a discipline's constituents, research, and practices. This article identifies the major areas under the instructional communication umbrella that '' Jim'' developed, nurtured, and expanded through his research and his direct mentoring relationships and collaborations with others. The unique relationship each coauthor of this article had with McCroskey produces several distinct sections: Historical influences on his initial career, communication constructs and the learning model, his early work on person perception variables (ethos, attraction, homophily), communication and classroom influence (immediacy, power), traits and the communibiological model (communication apprehension, willingness to communicate, argumentativeness), methodological approaches, and disciplinary service and mentoring.},

  abstract = {This dissertation focuses on Max Horkheimer's {$<$}italic{$>$}Institut f{\"u}r Sozialforschung{$<$}/italic{$>$} as a case study in the recent transatlantic history of ideas. By examining the encounters between German and U.S. thought during one of the most fruitful periods of cross-fertilization, this project charts the rise of our academic Atlantic culture, which has flourished in the wake of the Second World War. No doubt communication and information technology have provided the material basis for this development, but the face-to-face roots of this relationship extend back to the '' Intellectual Migration,'' when Germans and Americans struggled to learn from the intellectual and cultural differences that separated them. Settling in the United States in 1934, the members of the Horkheimer Circle charted an uncertain course from isolationism to assimilation and in the process became an intellectual phenomenon\textemdash{}the so-called '' Frankfurt School.'' While a great deal of research has been devoted to the intellectual and institutional history of the {$<$}italic{$>$}Institut f{\"u}r Sozialforschung {$<$}/italic{$>$}, relatively little attention has focused on the interactions that took place between members of the Horkheimer Circle and the communities of American scholars and readers that came in contact with them. My narrative concentrates on the main crossroads of transatlantic exchange in the Horkheimer Circle's history. Chapter one presents a summary of the history of the '' Frankfurt School,'' and offers an introduction to Critical Theory; chapter two explores the primary institutional relationship that dominated the exile experience of the {$<$}italic{$>$}Institut f{\"u}r Sozialforschung {$<$}/italic{$>$}, Columbia University; chapter three uncovers the web of inter-relationships and discussions about culture that arose between the Horkheimer Circle and the '' New York Intellectuals;'' chapter four explores the complex world of post-war sociology\textemdash{}the awkward disciplinary home of the '' Frankfurt School'' in exile; and the final portion of the dissertation, chapter 5, examines the complex relationship between the Horkheimer Circle and the American New Left\textemdash{}specifically, untangling Herbert Marcuse's connections to the student radicalism of the late 1960s and thus trying to distinguish between the myths and realities regarding Critical Theory at the high point of its U.S. reception.},

While it is often claimed that news journalism over recent decades has changed from being predominantly descriptive to becoming increasingly interpretive, our review suggests that there is a lack of systematic research in this area. The literature is furthermore characterized by different conceptualizations and operationalizations of interpretive journalism, as well as by different normative assumptions. Taken together, this suggests not only insufficient conceptual clarity, but also problems related to the comparability and cumulativity of findings. To remedy this, and based on our review of how interpretive journalism has been conceptualized and operationalized, this article suggests how interpretive journalism should be conceptualized and operationalized in order to increase conceptual clarity, comparability across studies, and ultimately research cumulativity.},

For a researcher based in the sociology of scientific knowledge, being an Internet researcher has been a vivid opportunity to experience at firsthand a phenomenon usually studied from the outside. The article begins by assessing some models of the process of scientific change. Characterizing Internet research as new has been a potent resource for enrolling researchers into the field and positioning research responses. The development of virtual methods for doing social research illustrates the process of methodological innovation in social science and the negotiation of methodological adequacy. Methodological discussions have been enlivened by the advent of the Internet as an object of study. Internet research has arguably been a valuable reflexive opportunity for the traditional disciplines that have fed its development.},

The performative concept of '' global theater'' has been overlooked by media ecology commentators, who tend to interpret it as a colorful detail\textemdash{}a loose element in McLuhan's overall system\textemdash{}often associating it with a shift from detached contemplation to involved production. This essay argues that a mere shift from theory to praxis is not enough to fully comprehend this enigmatic concept, which holds one of the keys for understanding the late McLuhan's transition from an extended configuration, anchored in the constitutive subject, to a postfinite philosophy of difference, sense, and multiplicities akin to the '' new realist'' school of contemporary thought, particularly the '' fields-of-sense'' ontology of Markus Gabriel.},

Three criticisms proved decisive to this undoing; political conservatism; problems of logic, mainly tautology and an inappropriate appeal to teleological explanations; and a tendency to impose psychological and sociological analyses on specifically cultural materials. Formulated in reference to systemic Parsonian functionalism, which dominated the broader social sciences, these criticisms are relatively easy to reconcile within the contextual, actionist Mertonian tradition, which took root in the communications context, but only through a constructive dialogue with the cultural studies and cultural indicators approaches, both of which have spent the last decade investigating a traditionally functionalist concern - the hypothesis of cultural systems integration. If functionalism offers to this cross-fertilization a focus on the normative orders of society, the cultural indicators approach provides a rigorous methodology and cultural studies cautions a greater sensitivity to social hierarchies},

On asking about the state of advertising research in earlier days, he said that research was not as precise, not as sophisticated in techniques in those days. Moreover, it was not as easy to do the variety of cross tabulations that can be done today with computers and mechanized tabulating services. It was much slower in terms of development of reports, although I think most management people always wanted the answer the next day. In those days, one would give a timetable for a report that today you could not get away with at all. Answering to a question related to the problems and issues that are faced by researchers today, he said that, one of the problems that research faces today, and this was true earlier as well, is that the end use of the research is not necessarily thought of by the researcher. And there are other kinds of research. There's a research for its own sake, and that's very valuable. But in the applied research, sometimes the researcher gets carried away with methodology and loses track of some of the applications of the information.},

Evidence that a clear disciplinary identity or '' self-concept'' is emerging in terms of a social science of communication is presented. This identity differentiates the emerging discipline from its various predecessors, including speech and journalism. While there is less evidence to be brought to bear on the second issue, what evidence there is indicates that respectability (and disciplinary maturity) is increasing, but that there is still much progress to be made.},

Design/methodology/approach Motivation in Advertising is reviewed and summarized, and its contributions to marketing and advertising history, thought and practice are assessed. Findings Martineau was among a handful of figures behind the '' motivation research'' movement among marketers and advertisers during the late 1940s to the 1960s. His '' new philosophy'' regarding communication theory, persuasion and advertising message strategy and tactics remains highly influential and relevant. Written during a period of tremendous growth in consumption in the USA and a revolution in the use of qualitative research in marketing and advertising, Martineau's book represents much more than a work about his experiences with motivation research, but a significant contribution to advertising communication theory as well. Originality/value Pierre Martineau was the subject of a historical biography (Martin, 1985), which also focused substantially on the principal themes and contributions of Motivation in Advertising. The book was also widely reviewed shortly after its publication. This more recent review and assessment, however, reveals the work's valuable historical insights into how postmodern consumption evolved and many present-day perspectives of consumer behavior and advertising effects coalesced during the Consumer Revolution and at the outset of modern advertising's '' Golden Age''.},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to review Advertising in a Free Society \textendash{} a defence of the advertising industry \textendash{} by Ralph Harris and Arthur Seldon, and to evaluate its status as a justifiable forgotten classic of the marketing literature. Design/Methodology/Approach \textendash{} Advertising in a Free Society is placed in historical context (the Cold War), summarised and reviewed. Findings \textendash{} During the 1950s, as the UK experienced a period of affluence and growing consumerism, the advertising industry was again subject to the criticisms that had been levelled at it by influential scholars in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Against this context, Advertising in a Free Society deserves to be remembered as one of the earliest defences of advertising and remains highly relevant. Harris and Seldon were leading figures in the Institute of Economic Affairs (IEA), joining shortly after its inception, which became an influential group both in the UK and abroad, influencing policy on free markets. Originality/Value \textendash{} Although Advertising in a Free Society attracted few citations (going out of print between its publication in 1959 and 2014 when it was republished by the IEA), and largely forgotten by marketing scholars, it provides a significant source for marketing historians interested in advertising criticism, the growth of the British advertising industry and the role of advertising in democratic societies. A reanalysis of the text situated in its historical context \textendash{} the height of the Cold War \textendash{} reveals that the text can be viewed as an artefact of the conflict, deploying the rhetoric of the period in defending the advertising industry and highlighting the positive role that advertising could make in free societies.},

  title = {Feminism and {{Women}}'s {{Film Criticism}} in {{Post}}-{{War Britain}}, 1945\textendash{}1959},

  abstract = {Feminist film criticism is widely thought to have started in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the "Images of Woman" debate associated with critics such as Marjorie Rosen provided the foundation for later developments in feminist film theory. Antonia Lant has recently claimed the immediate post-1950 period to be a barren time for female-authored publications on film and cinema. This article argues that, contrary to received wisdom, the post-war period (1945-1959) in Britain was a time when women's film criticism flourished, with writers such as Dilys Powell, C.A. Lejeune, Catherine de la Roche and E. Arnot Robertson enjoying high-profile careers. Moving beyond a simple recovery of women's "hidden histories," this article highlights the points of connection between the post-war period and later film criticism informed by second wave feminism. Through a case study of de la Roche and Robertson this article explores how women critics in this period were similarly preoccupied with screen representations of women and women's roles within the film industry, anticipating the later concerns of Rosen and others. I argue that a cross-media focus is a productive method for generating insights into women's critical agency at this time, and conclude that women's film criticism demonstrates something of the wider shifts taking place in gender relations in British society.},

It was almost comparable to asking people why they thought they were neurotic or to a physician asking a patient whatever disease he thought he had. Answering to a question as to what was his perspective and problems when he first entered the field, and how he sees the issues and problems today he said that, there have been some improvements but not enough to satisfy him. There are beautiful correlation coefficients being established which demonstrate that a particular group of people happen to be using this particular product more frequently. But then the jump is made that they are buying it because they are young, and that's where the problem arises.},

  abstract = {Elwood Murray (1897\textendash{}1988) was a pioneer in communication education. Beginning in the 1930s, he applied nontraditional methods in the speech classroom to encourage students to internalize and apply what they learned, and to view knowledge holistically. Drawing on the work of Kunkel, Moreno, Lewin, and Korzybski, Murray focused on developing skills in interpersonal and group communication. He facilitated classroom activities that he believed would bring about positive change in students' personalities as well as enhance their relationships and leadership ability. Communication methodologies, he argued, could facilitate learning in all fields and foster interdisciplinary understanding. In spite of much skepticism by his colleagues, Murray introduced innovative classroom practices that advanced our thinking about instructional communication.},

However, the few moments in which he does reflect on popular music are highly revealing. In this article I provide a comprehensive overview and a critical analysis of Said's public statements on popular music, and argue that these strongly create dissonance with his interventions in postcolonial theory and politics. More specifically, I argue that in these reflections on popular music Said voices problematic elitist, orientalist, and universalist claims. Consequently, Said's notion of popular music constitutes perhaps the most antagonistic aspect of his oeuvre.},

  abstract = {Edward C. Stewart's work has been much affected by his own experiences and the historical spaces he and his families of origin have occupied. He remains one of the most complex members of the intercultural field. Although he played a key role in the initial organization of the field in the 1970s, he has also been the quintessential '' outsider.'' As a French-Swiss-Southern American-Brazilian, his multicultural perspective is novel. His initial academic formation was in experimental psychology with a focus on perception. During his whole career he has been creating comprehensive conceptual frameworks for the complex intercultural communication field of inquiry. One of Stewart's earliest pioneering efforts was at the 1974 conference held in Chicago to establish the intercultural field sponsored by the Speech Communication Association (SCA, now the National Communication Association, NCA), the International Communication Association (ICA) and the newly developing Society for Intercultural Education, Training and Research (SIETAR). At this conference Stewart's 40-page 1973 '' Outline of Intercultural Communication'' provided the '' text'' that the 200 participants, divided into small groups, discussed. Stewart began his work with a focus on cultural differences, using a contrast culture approach. This approach produced his two most famous works, the '' Contrast American'' or '' Contrast Culture Method (CCM) of Intercultural Training'' and his book, American Cultural Patterns: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Although this approach moves beyond simple contrasts to embrace similarities and the realization that differences are a matter of degree (Paige, 1993), later in his career Stewart focused more on adaptation, on dialectical, and contrasting forces. This all goes back to his original intellectual formation as a student of Harry Helson, the neurophysiologist, and Helson's idea that perception itself is an act of creation. This is the platform upon which Stewart constructed a cognitive/emotional/aesthetic dialectical geometry in which all '' liveliness'' includes seeming opposites AND the space between, the interface where relationships are formed. Stewart's most recent synthesis-in-process is a proposal to create a graduate level university course, '' Culture as the Central Social Science'' and an accompanying text, Forces of Identity (FORID) for Culture-Building. The idea is that this course would be a required course for any of the social sciences. Stewart's latest ideas (see part 6 Epilogue below) move way beyond a simple dialectical orientation to become a five-part (Seenko) framework for analyzing culture. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We examine Stewart's multicultural background and early formative experiences, especially his WWII experiences. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We examine the formative influence on Stewart's work of neuropsychologist Harry Helson's idea that perception itself is a creative act. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We identify Stewart's key contributions to the IC field, the Culture Contrast Method (CCM), American Cultural Patterns, etc. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} We discuss his current syntheses-in-progress, a course, a textbook and a five-part framework for analyzing culture.},

  title = {Education and the {{Mass Media}}: {{The Origins}} of {{Mass Communications Research}} in the {{United States}}, 1939-1955},
  abstract = {This study examines the development of mass communications research as an area of study at United States universities during World War II and the Cold War. By mid-century mass communications researchers became recognized experts in describing the effects of the mass media on learning and other social behavior. This study analyzes the ideological and historical forces which gave rise to, and shaped, their research. The growth of the various technologies of mass communication in the early part of the twentieth century was a source of great concern, as well as a source of great optimism, among educators. Between World War I and World War II educators engaged in a wide ranging debate about the role of these mass media, centered largely around the issue of propaganda and its relationship to democracy and education. The dissertation presents an overview of this debate and argues that the debate subsided with the outbreak of World War II. The United States involvement in World War II required the creation of propaganda agencies whose primary goal was the development of techniques of mass persuasion. Scholars who went to work for these agencies sharpened their expertise in these areas, and made important personal contacts which facilitated the development of the field. Since the term "propaganda" had come to possess negative connotations, these researchers orchestrated a semantic shift away from "propaganda" to "mass communications." The field was enhanced by the large governmental research contracts which were awarded to university-based mass communications researchers during the Cold War. The work of several key figures in this research is discussed, including Berelson, Stanton, Hovland, Cantril, and Dodd. The work of Paul Lazarsfeld and Wilbur Schramm is reviewed, based on archival records. Lazarsfeld's early interest in this research is located in his adherence to socialism as a youth in Vienna. Schramm's interest in persuasion stems from his education in the neo-humanist tradition of Norman Foerster. The conclusion argues that ideological commitments of key researchers in the field, as well as other historical forces, had a major impact on the way in which these researchers came to view the mass media.},

Every major polling firm predicted a win for Thomas Dewey over Harry Truman in the 1948 presidential election\textemdash{}and of course they all got it wrong. This failure generated considerable criticisms of polling and pollsters were forced to defend their craft, the quantitative analysis of public sentiment. Pathways to Polling argues that early political pollsters, market researchers, and academic and government survey researchers were entrepreneurial figures who interacted through a broad network that was critical to the growth of public opinion enterprises. This network helped polling pioneers gain and maintain concrete, financial support to further their discrete operations. After the Truman-Dewey debacle, such links helped political polling survive when it could have just as easily been totally discredited. Amy Fried demonstrates how interactions between ideas, organizations, and institutions produced changes in the technological, political, and organizational paths of public opinion polling, notably affecting later developments and practice. Public opinion enterprises have changed a good deal, in the intervening half century, even as today's approaches have been deeply imprinted by these early efforts.},

The issue opens with freshly commissioned introductory essays to these three thematic areas by key authors in those fields. In addition, the issue offers new articles showcasing the range of the broad field of cultural studies today, including pieces on the politics of co-working, punk in China, Black British women on YouTube, trans-pedagogy and fantasy sports gameplay, featuring work by emerging as well as established scholars. Our editorial introduction to this celebratory issue offers reflections on how both the journal and the field of cultural studies have developed, and on our thoughts and ambitions for the future within the current conjuncture as we 'move on' as a new editorial team.},

The task of preparing law students for their professional life is compared to that of teaching undergraduates who, in the uniquely strenuous College of the University of Chicago, are interested in books and ideas and are not im\- mediately job-driven. Whereas in the law school setting the author, like other law professors, worked alone, in the College he worked with a staff of colleagues who shared in the choice of readings and in lectures to the entire student body-altogether, in the author's view, a more demanding task for the teacher. Graduate education in sociology is again different: the student is an apprentice professional, but there is no clear road toward professional prac\- tice; the faculty member as mentor on the disse:rtation helps pilot the appren\- tice through the cross-currents of conflict in the field and in the particular department. Teaching undergraduates in Harvard College, the author reports, involved tasks different from those faced in the College of the University of Chicago. Rather than working, as at Chicago, with a staff of presumptive equals, at Harvard the author recruited advanced graduate students and junior (and on occasion, senior) faculty whom he treated as colleagues, but whom Harvard undergraduates tended to deprecate as mere "section men," i.e. teaching assistants. The author details efforts to overcome what was 30 years ago the fabled yet quite real pose of "Harvard indifference"-a lack of engagement with subject matter and with noncelebrity faculty. The Harvard colleague group worked to get students to do small pieces of fieldwork, not merely as exercises, but out of interest in a topic and an idea. When with the rise of a radical student-faculty "movement" many undergraduates became less "cool," the problems of teaching subtly changed. Always, the author notes, teaching is contextual and often needs to work against the prevailing tide.},

It spurred an entire literature of academic research both about \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} and the idea of technology assessment more generally. Understanding the legislative history and implementation of the Technology Assessment Act is crucial not just for scholarship, though. \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} was a blueprint for institutionalizing politically accountable technology assessment. Even as technologies advance at rapid rates, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} still offers valuable lessons that scholars and policy-makers alike ought to glean. This paper places \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} in a contemporary context of (institutionalized) technology assessment. It contributes to a better understanding of OTA's origins by tracing its lineage to a set of federal reports beginning in 1929. It then analyzes OTA's response to pragmatic implementation questions of how to strike a balance between speed, depth, scope, and temporal focus. Lastly, it uses a public values framework to critique OTA's failure to adequately incorporate participatory elements into its processes.},

The article then suggests engaging in areas that exemplify interconnectedness between national cinemas.

Findings showed that the number of mobile communication-related studies increased over the time period of interest. Scholars examined uses and users' characteristics of mobile communication as well as the effects of mobile media on everyday life. Most studies used quantitative methods such as survey of the general population. Theories or theoretical models were not frequently used in mobile communication research. Regarding the usage of theories or theoretical models, about half of mobile communication studies (48.1\%) used theories and/or models as theoretical frameworks.

Ong did not identify with any philosophical school or movement, preferring to interpret philosophy simply as love of wisdom, which is best pursued not by logic and treatise, but by rhetoric and conversation. Beginning during his formative years at Saint Louis University in the 1940s, he integrated metaphysics and communication, suggesting that the focus of philosophy should be not on the idea but on being. It is within these perspectives that Ong probed issues that later became identified with media ecology. Thomism provided a '' furniture of mind'' to weigh post-Hegelian dialectic and to probe the implications of existentialistic dialogue (Jaspers, Camus-Sartre, Marcel); to phenomenologically explore personalist interiority and encounter (Lavelle, Buber, Hopkins); to interpret human thought within the context of cosmic time and evolution (Teilhard); to consider speech philosophy as an alternative to Ramist and Cartesian methodology (Rosenstock-Huessy); and to promulgate an oral hermeneutic that contextualizes concept within being (Bakhtin, Rosenstock-Huessy).

Casmir conceptualized the framework as an active process whereby different cultural groups come together to form a third culture between them. The third culture then becomes a common ground for all participants; a cognitive space that incorporates elements of both cultures and yet remains separate and distinct. Third culture building is a departure from adoption (the process of taking on the cultural mores of another) or adaptation (modifying one's cultural mores to better fit those of another), and achieved through deliberate development in an extended process, during which all participants gain an understanding of, and appreciation for, one another. In this essay, the authors review the life and work of Fred Casmir \textendash{} a leading figure in establishing intercultural communication as a specific area of study. Next the authors discuss the ideological foundations, intended use, key applications and heuristic value of Casmir's third culture building framework.},

Scholars in the Humanities have traditionally studied the meaning of human expression in language, philosophy, the Arts and literature. Social scientists have focused on the relations between media institutions and other institutions, not least political ones. With the so-called 'cultural turn' in the 1980s, media scholars' interest shifted to the role of media in the development of culture, on the potential of media to generate meaning in a broader sense, and on the adaptation of media messages to culturally dominant forms of understanding. Today, the field is characterized by extreme diversity and extensive specialization. Studies on the systems level are few. At the same time, contemporary multicultural and global societies raise more complex issues than ever before. Given the high degree of specialization, scholars in the field may not be exposed to the impulses needed for them to be able to formulate incisive research problems. For the discipline to produce new insights and new knowledge requires collaboration - within the discipline, but above all collaboration across academic as well as national frontiers},

Still, in the era of globalization, internationalistic agendas have to be radicalized, opened up also to non-Western media thought, setting out from existing regional modernities and transformations. Thus, globalization calls for regional, not universalistic epistemologies and for cross-disciplinary, not intra-disciplinary research efforts. The chapter develops these arguments, first by recapitulating the criticism of the media and development paradigm \textendash{} an early theory of media and social change. This is followed up by a summary report on media and global inequalities in the post-Cold War period, suggesting that the relations between media, politics and economy develop contrary to the prescriptions of received models. This leads to a reinforced questioning of the very distinctions between, e.g., politics, economy and culture in media studies, as illustrated by examples from case studies of recent developments in new democracies and (neo)authoritarian systems.},

Mass has also been a pejorative for critics of modern capitalist society and its culture. In the years after World War II, this latter use of the term became the target of a broadside attack by several highly credentialed scholars, who questioned its value as an analytic tool. This paper, starting with Ferdinand T{\"o}nnies, offers a brief overview of both the origins of the concept of mass and its subsequent refinement by French, German, and American sociologists into the mid-1930s. Distinguishing between its ideological connotations and the analytic use of the term helps us to focus on the most general and persistent effects of mass communication: expanding the range of common experience and making people more responsive to distant events. This effect is magnified by the ubiquity of mass media; practically no one, not even those who scorn them, can altogether escape their influence.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is an intellectual history and critical analysis of medium theory investigations of communication technologies. The more common approaches to viewing technology as savior or slayer are a consequence of the technological sublime in our time of technological saturation. It is argued that the way to break out of this technological sublime-induced grand dichotomy is to follow the lead of medium theorists who investigate the unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture, and to follow the lead of marxists who place technological developments within the larger dynamic of a system based on the drive for profit. Intellectual influences and theoretical implications of the work of prominent scholars such as Harold Adams Innis, Herbert Marshall McLuhan, Joshua Meyrowitz, James Carey, Walter Ong, and Neil Postman are analyzed throughout the dissertation. The main contribution of medium theorists has been their ability to analyze the impact of unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture; their collective weakness has been a tendency to slight important social factors such as the drive for profit, inequality, and class. To correct this problem, it is argued that medium theory should be merged with an activist marxist tradition. A synthesis of activist marxism and medium theory, it is argued, will give to marxist scholars a better sense of unintended consequences and to medium theorists a better sense of the drive for profit, inequality, and class. Finally, it is argued that scholarship in general, and marxist/medium theory scholarship in particular, is most fruitful when scholars are actively aware of, and engaged in, significant struggles of the day. Just as activist marxists argue for theoretically informed activism, scholarship would benefit from activist informed theory. It is at the point of praxis, theory informed action and action informed theory, that thought and action converge to enhance understanding of our world and to make the world a better place.},

  abstract = {What does `Internet studies' entail as a field of social science research? We aim to answer the question by mapping research themes, theorization, and methodology of Internet studies based on 27,000+ articles published in Social Sciences Citation Index and Arts \& Humanities Citation Index journals over the last 10 years. In analyzing the articles, we adopt a `bottom-up' approach classifying keywords of the Internet studies without any a priori categorization to identify the boundaries, major divisions, and basic elements of the field talis qualis. The research strategy results in a number of expected, as well as surprising, patterns and trends. Internet studies have evolved into a viable field that has witnessed a booming decade. The field is clustered around four primary research themes: e-Health, e-Business, e-Society, and Human Technology Interactions. Two or three sub-themes with different research foci and methodologies emerge within each theme. The evolution of popular keywords in each sub-theme further shows that the field has become more concerned with intricate relationships between Internet use and specific behaviors/attitudes/effects; Internet usage patterns have increasingly attracted research attention; and network perspectives and approaches have become popular. Internet studies in the past decade have been modestly theorized. Established research methods (e.g., survey, experiment, and content analysis) still prevail in the Internet studies reviewed.},

  abstract = {Given the critical role of communication technologies in Asia's robust economic, cultural, and technological performance in the current century, this study maps the landscape of communication technology research in Asia of the recent two decades. Using a combination of content analysis and text mining-based semantic network analysis, this paper reviews 272 articles on Asian communication technology published in SSCI communication journals between 1995 and 2014. Our results show that East Asia was the most studied region in this field. Internet was the most popular keyword, and it was also the most studied communication technology followed by mobile phone, information communication technologies, and social media. Adopting a variety of methodologies and balancing between qualitative and quantitative, most of these studies took the psychological micro-level scope. When it comes to technology\textendash{}context relation, the majority of research took the technology determinism perspective. Asian-based scholars leaned to technology determinism and are more likely to see technology as a change force for Asia, whereas the Western-based counterparts viewed Asian context as a filter and took macro-level scope in their research more often. The technology\textendash{}context relationship and regional diversity discussed in this paper also shed light on future studies to make theoretical contributions to this important research field.},

It observes at the outset the seminal contribution of Daniel Bell's conception of Post-Industrial Society, characterizing it as blending theory with empirical observation while providing an account of the most consequential features of change. Sociology in the UK during the 1980s largely ignored macro-level analysis and focused on work and employment, took its starting point as opposition to the technological determinism associated with this first wave enthusiasm for the 'microelectronics revolution', and produced localized and textured studies. Manuel Castells' conception of the Network Society, while distinctive, signalled a return to the scale and scope offered by Bell, notably in being a macro analysis that combined theory and empirical evidence. Castells' contribution coincided with a second wave of technological enthusiasm associated especially with the Internet. Alongside this Sociology in Britain has experienced the rise of Cultural Studies, a field that has competed for important parts of what might have been considered Sociology's terrain. Indeed, Cultural Studies has outpaced Sociology in response to recent changes in the information domain. Its emergence expressed little concern with technological determinism, embracing 'virtuality' and being more open to the exploration of expanding culture. Nonetheless, Cultural Studies remains methodologically flawed while, like so much sociological research on ICTs and information, seemingly incapable of combining theory and empirical evidence that identify and explain the major contours of change.},

Over the last decade, the internet has emerged as a new communicative infrastructure and cultural forum on a global scale. Revisiting and reworking Newcomb and Hirsch's classic contribution, this article: first, advances a model of the internet as a distinctive kind of medium comprising different communicative genres \textemdash{} one-to-one, one-to-many as well as many-to-many communication; and, second, the article presents an empirical baseline study of their current prevalence. The findings suggest that while blogs, social network sites and other recent genres have attracted much public as well as scholarly attention, ordinary media users may still be more inclined to engage in good old-fashioned broadcasting and interpersonal interaction. Despite a constant temptation to commit prediction, future research is well advised to ask how old communicative practices relate to new media.},

Although audience research has long been characterized by struggles between critical and administrative schools of communication, and between opposed perspectives on the relation of the individual to society, Katz and Lazarsfeld's work, and subsequent work by Katz and his collaborators, suggests possibilities for convergence, or at least productive dialogue, across hitherto polarized perspectives as researchers collectively seek to understand how, in their everyday lives, people can, and could, engage with media to further democratic participation in the public sphere.},

After the publication of the English language version of Henri Bergson's Creative Evolution in 1911, the analytic philosopher Bertrand Russell published a polemic attack against him. This disagreement between the two can be seen to focus on the proper role of analysis. Where Bergson believed that through intuition we can come to see something of the wholeness of a thing, Russell believed this to be a preposterous claim. I examine how this fissure between the two concerning the importance of intuition and analysis has reoccurred in the debate between David Bordwell and V.F. Perkins concerning the former's book, Making Meaning: Inference and Rhetoric in the Interpretation of Cinema (1989), as well as how Bergson's concept of duration has influenced the early film theorist and film-maker Jean Epstein. Interestingly, this influence has again come under attack by another analytic thinker: Malcolm Turvey.},

His idea of bridging islands of theory has provided many of us with a broad, integrated vision of social science. His workman-like approach to scholarship has provided us with the tools needed to contribute to the field. As a broad theorist, Harold inspired us to devote a lifetime in pursuit of knowledge. As a mentor, he imparted the essential skills of writing for publication, presenting at professional meetings, teaching and advising, and contributing to the profession. Above all, his values of interdisciplinary and responsible scholarship have been a hallmark of my own research and project leadership. My work on simulation reflects these values as well, with regard to research platforms and classroom learning.

  abstract = {The Commission on Freedom of the Press, chaired by Robert M. Hutchins, met from 1944 to 1946 and issued its summary report in 1947. Social Responsibility Theory of the press was thus given its most articulate statement to that time. The years prior to the meetings of these thirteen Commissioners were ripe with challenge for traditional democratic theory. A new Weltanschauung\textendash{}scientific naturalism\textendash{}was riding the crest of a new wave of empiricism, pragmatism, instrumentalism, sociological jurisprudence, and 'value-free' social science. World events, however, demanded a strong moral defense of traditional democracy. The moral neutrality of scientific naturalism offered little rationale for the struggle against fascism. The Thirties, therefore, saw a variety of movements attempting to recover a moral base: The Harvard humanists, the Southern Agrarians, the Neo-Thomists, various social theorists typified by Pitirim Sorokin, and the resurgence of metaphysical philosophy at the University of Chicago. The latter was primarily the work of Robert Hutchins and his associate Mortimer Adler. Besides Hutchins, were the other twelve Commissioners involved in the resurgence of moral theory? Were the deliberations and conclusions of Commission proceedings influenced by this struggle in worldview? The Commissioners appealed for foundational presuppositions to three ways of understanding the world. The classical humanists (Hutchins and others) looked to the 'Great Conversation' of Western tradition for the moral justification of democracy. The Christian humanists (Niebuhr, Hocking, Shuster) rested their case for moral values on transcendent authority. The empirical humanists (Merriam, Lasswell, others) fully accepted the new scientism but insisted on moral authority for reasons their worldview could not justify. The Commission's dominant voices were the classical and the Christian humanists. They participated more aggressively in Commission debates; many of their ideas were reflected in the reports of 1947. Social responsibility theory of the press, therefore, is rightly viewed as an effort to recover a moral base for freedom of speech, a moral base strong enough to speak to the modern era of the virtues of traditional democracy.},

This book, published in the post-World War II consumer boom, exposed a mass audience to motivational research at a time when advertisers used new techniques and a new medium. Yet The Hidden Persuaders was highly criticized and became a scapegoat for purportedly promoting subliminal techniques. Nonetheless, the book helped shape public opinion, advertising regulation, and advertising research and practice. This paper provides a historical approach to Packard's contribution and ideas in the context of recent theoretical insights into psychological processing and new persuasion practices.

Contrasted with coverage of politics as issues, the framing of politics as a strategic game is marked by features such as winning and losing as the central concern and a focus on how candidates or parties are doing in opinion polls. The pervasiveness of such framing is, however, disputed since (1) the way in which the frames are conceptualized and operationalized differs significantly; and (2) while some use terms such as 'game frame' and 'strategy frame' as synonymous, others argue that there is a conceptual difference between them. Against this background, this article reviews research on the media's framing of politics as a strategic game, what concepts have been used, and how they have been operationalized; and suggests a synthesis and ways of improving conceptual clarity and comparability in research on the media's use of strategy and/or game frames.},

  volume = {6},
  abstract = {Fifty-seven famous professors from all over the world talk about their careers, from their beginning to today. The interviews start with family background, early days, and professional dreams, before moving into the world of ideas. They look back to dealing with decisions over which graduate school to attend, main academic teachers, and the state of the discipline at the time, and then continue with both the intellectual and the institutional steps which led to fame and recognition within and, in almost all cases, even outside the field. Last but not least, all interviewees were asked about the discipline itself: What is communication all about? Is there a kind of core, although the discipline is highly diverse in methods, theories, and objects of study (Stanfill, 2012)? What is the reputation of the subject today? Is communication still seen as an '' academic Taiwan'' (claiming all of China as its own tiny island; Peters, 1986, p. 544), or, similarly unfavorably, as a stepchild that is tolerated by U.S. university administrators only because it helps to pay the bill for the departments they really care about? What about the '' rest'' of the world, and what about the '' big unknowns'' (Sonia Livingstone), such as China, for example, where they seem to open a new university every week? These interviews are not only a source for future historians of the discipline and a blueprint for junior scholars that strive for a professorship, but also a document of the early 21st century: Where did communication come from? What does the worldwide landscape of this fast growing academic enterprise look like today? And where do we go from here\textemdash{}let's say, until 2030?},

At the narrative and moral core of the story is a group of remarkable yet unsung women who, from the late 1930s through the early 1950s, helped to invent practices, produce research, shape thinking, and establish social relationships that laid foundations for media and communication study in the United States and the world. These women are the figures we call the founding mothers of our field.

  abstract = {This paper is a comparative analysis of the telecommunications policy-making process in China and India. Adopting an institutionalist perspective and multi-streams framework, the paper analyzes the formal structures, rule-making procedures and interest groups involved in telecommunications policy-making in the two countries, in terms of their evolution over the last two decades. Though the two systems began this period with a somewhat similar ministerial-bureaucratic decision-making model, and faced similar problems of assimilating new interest groups and responding to international pressures, the paper finds that the decision systems in the two countries evolved in significantly different directions. China's telecommunications decision-making is significantly affected by the macro level political rearrangement and is more likely to be non-incremental. On the other hand, confronted by an increasingly litigious environment and a more fractious interest group culture, India represents a somewhat classical textbook case of incremental policy making. Nevertheless, numerous challenges remain in both countries, including institutional capacity and excessive regulatory deference to political authority. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} From a comparative lens, the impact of institutional endowment on policy making is illustrated. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The telecom policy making in India is incremental while China is more likely to be non-incremental. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Challenges such as excessive regulatory deference to political power remain in both countries.},

  abstract = {The aims and status of arts and culture criticism are currently up for revision and under attack, according to a whole host of indicators. It is clear that the reasons for the current situation include the worldwide recession, the recent drop in print advertising revenues and, more fundamentally, the declining circulations attributable to reluctant consumers of print media. These developments have brought forth ontological, if not existential, questions about the purpose and worth of criticism in the age of WordPress blogospheres and a perceived democratization of criticism. Despite the 'brave new world' rhetoric underpinning the debate, precedents and some of the solutions to these 'new media' problems are to be found in old historical lessons. This article focuses one such case study. Examining Sight and Sound's 1960 'Critical Question', a reaction to Cahiers du cin{\'e}ma but, more importantly, an intervention into a key debate on the purpose of criticism instructs us about the construction of particular, Lionel Trilling-inspired kind of 'liberal' taste that would come to define Sight and Sound's part in the establishment of a 'broad church' national film culture, a role it plays to this day.},

This article also examines Thompson's contributions to historiography, his engagement with the contextualised histories of ordinary people and their contributions to the making of the public sphere in 18th-century England. This article argues that the contributions made by these two theorists enable a critique of structures and a re-centring of agency, both of which are critical to a renewal of communication for social change theory.},

Analyzing the talk as a discursive practice demonstrates both the value of discourse analysis and some contradictions of the policy process. The talk treated cable as an autonomous technology and consequently obscured political and economic conditions while exaggerating cable's uniqueness; these characteristics encouraged the reconceptualization of cable in the policy arena in a way that, in combination with several other forces, led to the reregulation of cable and its subsequent growth. The discourse thus helped shape an institution that it failed to describe.},

  abstract = {This article investigates the role of names, naming, and anonymity in the career and reception history of Siegfried Kracauer. A signature motif of his life and writings, the notion of anonymity is ambivalent, signaling both invisibility and success. The article traces this motif from its treatment in Kracauer's novel Ginster to the role the author ascribes to it in his correspondence with Theodor W. Adorno, to the posthumous fate of his works on both sides of the Atlantic. A comparative reception history shows the different valences of Kracauer's name in German and Anglo-American scholarship, particularly in the history of film studies. The article situates the trope of anonymity at the heart of Kracauer's oeuvre, where it helps define a nonsovereign subject in response to modernity.},

Theoretically, the study builds on the sociology of culture and education in the tradition of Bourdieu and some of his successors, and its methodological design is that of a comprehensive survey of the entire corpus of academic theses produced within the Norwegian music field. On this basis, the authors examine what forms of popular music have been included and excluded respectively, how this aesthetic and cultural expansion has found its legitimate scholarly expression, and which structural forces seem to govern the processes of academisation of popular music in the Norwegian context. The results show that popular music to a large extent has been successfully academised, but also that this process has led to some limitations of academic openness as well as the emergence of new power hierarchies.},

Hall's academic life grew out of his growing racial awareness and his political engagement with key events of the post-World War II era. In seeking a third analytic space, driven neither by Soviet communist nor western capitalist values, Hall took up a traditional socialist path that would lead him into emerging intellectual formations in 1950s Britain. His academic life, which followed, would incorporate the wider range of concerns in the world, giving him global appeal as a thinker and writer.},

Williams's different formulations of the concept are discussed in terms of their ways of relating reflexive experience to institutional structures and in relation to the genetic structuralism of Goldmann and Bourdieu's concepts of habitus and cultural field. Three types of criticisms are considered, which have in common the contention that the concept is unclear. Operationalized in analysing literature and its symbols, it can contribute towards clarification of the complexity of the processes of reflexive communication of experience which are at the root of social order and change.},

  volume = {5},
  abstract = {Mass communication has always been an object of interdisciplinary study, but it is currently gaining a greater degree of autonomy. The paradigm that is emerging has probably been more influenced by sociology than by any other discipline. This review deals with literature, mainly published during the last five years, chosen according to the significance or representativeness of the main themes. Among thesc is media theory, where the field has proved very sensitive to wider debates within the social sciences, especially those provoked by the advocacy of more critical theory and research and by attacks on positivism. The cultural studies approach has gained ground, and there has been more interchange between humanistic and scientific approaches.

  abstract = {Mass communication has always been an object of interdisciplinary study, but it is currently gaining a greater degree of autonomy. The paradigm that is emerging has probably been more influenced by sociology than by any other discipline. This review deals with literature, mainly published during the last five years, chosen according to the significance or representativeness of the main themes. Among thesc is media theory, where the field has proved very sensitive to wider debates within the social sciences, especially those provoked by the advocacy of more critical theory and research and by attacks on positivism. The cultural studies approach has gained ground, and there has been more interchange between humanistic and scientific approaches. The question of media power has remained very much at the center of debate. The critical-cultural developments mentioned have made some contribution to a reconceptualization of the problem and to the adoption of new research strategies that pay more attention to long-term, institutional effects of media.

Prior to World War II, Allport, Katz, and Likert made pioneering contributions to understanding issues relevant to society, to the science of social psychology, and to methods of attitude measurement and poll design. In response to World War II, each of the three pursued research topics more immediately connected to the war effort. Similar to other prominent social psychologists, Allport, Katz, and Likert were able to parlay their prewar reputations into significant, high-level roles in the service of the World War II effort. In turn, these successes helped to lay the foundation for a postwar boom in social psychology that had implications for training in and research on social psychology. Nonetheless, social psychology's and society's utilization of the knowledge gained during World War II appears to have been less than optimal.},

  volume = {12},
  abstract = {In the UK we have recently witnessed a series of attacks on the overall project of cultural studies, both in the popular press and, within the academy, by scholars associated with the more established disciplines of sociology and anthropology. The critiques variously argue that cultural studies has led us into a political 'dead end' (in particular, in its emphasis on the study of cultural consumption); has abandoned 'politics' altogether (at least, in one definition of the term); has done little more than reinvent (in ignorance) the old (and indeed outmoded) theoretical wheels of an earlier intellectual tradition, and/or that, in general, the 'excesses' of its project have only confirmed the worst fears of those who were opposed to it in the first place. In these critiques it is argued that it is (somehow) both time to move 'beyond' cultural studies altogether, and time to return to the more secure disciplinary foundations and rigorous methodological procedures of sociology, and/or political economy and anthropology. This article considers the theoretical and political occasions of this interesting (hyper?) critical phenomenon, and considers whether, notwithstanding the very real current problems and divisions within cultural studies itself, the contributions of cultural studies over the last twenty years have now so transformed our field of study that the critics' proposed return to 'The Good Old Ways' may simply no longer be possible (even if it were desirable).},

The challenge coincides with the influence of complex modernist and postmodernist ideas related to notions of culture, ideology, and power, and the increasing relevance of the production of meaning in the study of social formations.

Fromm's primary emphasis is on evaluating the sanity of contemporary western societies, which he suggests often deny its citizens' basic human needs of productive activity, self-actualisation, freedom, and love. He suggests that the mental health of a society cannot be assessed in an abstract manner but must focus on specific economic, social, and political factors at play in any given society and should consider whether these factors contribute to insanity or are conducive to mental stability. Ultimately The Sane Society provides a radical critique of democratic capitalism that goes below surface symptoms to get to the root causes of alienation and to suggest ways to transform contemporary societies to further the productive activities of its citizens. Fromm envisions the refashioning of democratic capitalist societies based on the tenants of communitarian socialism, which stresses the organisation of work and social relations between its citizens rather than on issues of ownership.},

In contrast to these public relations masters of persuasion who had a pessimistic view of the human condition, Spinoza's Ethics is based on a positive anthropology of man that squares well with contemporary and more ethical relationship-building approaches to public relations.},

  abstract = {In this provocative study, Christopher Simpson demonstrates how the government-funded psychological warfare programs of the Cold War years underwrote the academic studies that formed the basis for much of modern communication research. U.S. psychological warfare programs in the Philippines, Middle East and Southeast Asia became essential in the creation and survival of what is widely considered to be mainstream mass communication studies. They aided in forming the widely held preconceptions that persist today in communication studies, public opinion research, and in the types of counterinsurgency operations that are today known as "public diplomacy" and "low intensity conflict.". Science of Coercion: Communication Research and Psychological Warfare, 1945-1960 provides the first thorough examination of the role of the CIA, Pentagon, and other U.S. security agencies in the evolution of modern communication studies. Christopher Simpson contends that it is unlikely that communication research could have emerged in its present form without regular transfusions of money from U.S. military, intelligence, and propaganda agencies during the Cold War. These agencies saw mass communication as an instrument for persuading or dominating targeted groups in the United States and abroad; as a tool for improving military operations; and perhaps most fundamentally, as a means to extend U.S. influence more widely than ever before at a relatively modest cost. Communication research, in turn, became for a time the preferred method for testing and developing such techniques . Science of Coercion outlines the history of U.S. psychological warfare between 1945 and 1960, discussing the underlying theories, activities, and administrative structure of this type of communication enterprise. In the process, Simpson documents the role played by prominent mass communication researchers including Wilbur Schramm, Ithiel de Sola Pool, Samuel Stouffer, and Paul Lazarsfield to demonstrate the links between the so-called "founding fathers" of communication studies in the United States and psychological warfare programs. Drawing on long-classified documents and extensive archival research, Simpson has produced a fascinating study in the history of science and the sociology of knowledge. Science of Coercion offers valuable insights into the dynamics of ideology and the social psychology of mass communication. It will provide informative reading for scholars and students of communication, the history of science, and social psychology, as well as the general reader.},

This is important because love of literature and commitment to a rigorous literary critical method inform all Hoggart's writing on culture. An understanding of his literary criticism is key to appreciating his cultural analysis and can also offer a way forward at a time when the literary may have been abandoned in the quest for the popular.},

It argues that the identity of the field of business communication and all variations thereof ought to be determined by the concep tual problematic underlying its intellectual inquiry rather than by its vocabu lary or instructional practices. On this basis, the paper advocates the view that business communication, management communication, and organizational communication are not, as suggested by the three articles, separate disciplines but interdependent areas of study nested within the domain of the mother discipline of communication. The paper concludes by making the plea for a more inclusive editorial policy that adopts an eclectic methodological stance and encourages substantive debates relating to the nature and processes of communication as constituted by the practical milieu of business.},

Today, information is no longer scarce, breaking news is no longer the province of professional journalists, mass media are declining in influence and news is easily personalized. Like many news organizations, journalism education programs are distinctly unprepared to respond to such deeply structural changes in the environment. Preliminary research indicates that the response to date has been primarily to expand technology training and reorient sequence and media emphasis tracks. The present study recommends a realignment of journalism education from an industry-centered model to a community-centered model as one way to re-engage journalism education in a more productive and vital role in the future of journalism. A community-centered focus could provide a way to conceptualize a reconstitution of journalism education to match that taking place in journalism beyond the university. Three examples from current journalism programs illustrate the implications of this analysis and provide an indication of future directions for realignment.},

  abstract = {The uses of the word, 'medium,' in communication research from 1920 through 1940 reveal a complex background of philosophical and historical development. By examining 'medium' and its development, this study argues that communication research carries with it the traces of a varied set of philosophical assumptions, many problematic and most unexamined. This varied background to contemporary work demands that the terminology of the area of study be placed in its historical, social, and disciplinary context. During the early period of communication research, 'medium' draws on four clusters of meaning: meanings associated with physical connection, meanings associated with representatives and representation, meanings associated with social formation and a social environment, and meanings associated with a secondary, instrumental, function. Educators, writers, and communication practitioners apply 'medium' to various kinds of communication, including transportation, the press, film, radio, and even language. In the 1920s these usages are specific and illustrate clear differences of meaning; by 1940 the instrumental meaning overshadows the others, as a secondary function attached to a primary denotation. The history of the word not only illumines the history of communication studies but also helps shape this area of study and its practices.},

With a focus on the United States, I identify several discourses in both the intellectual and broader socio-political context that were contemporary with the research and whose influences can be seen in these seminal studies. In particular: organizational theory\textemdash{}of the Marxist variety, a critique of professionalism, and the social construction of reality; as well as a broad rejection of institutional authority and a liberal call for pluralism. Having identified these influences, I ask what sort of blind spots this historically specific intellectual constellation produced, and how these blind spots still influence the media sociology of today. I conclude that the intellectual and socio-political contexts of the newsroom studies led their authors to over-emphasize organizational constraints, and to focus narrowly on the most influential news outlets and their official sources; contemporary ethnographies have placed greater emphasis on journalistic agency and on the networked nature of newswork, though I question whether an emphasis on organizational constraints is not still politically warranted.},

From 1941, when he first joined forces with Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University, through 1949, when he published his last articles in the area, Merton was active in the overlapping fields of propaganda, public opinion, and communications research. He codified methods, formulated middle range concepts, and composed a small but distinctive corpus that remains useful for contemporary study. Borrowing one of Merton's own concepts, this essay argues that his communications research was serendipitous\textemdash{}an unplanned, surprising, but highly productive episode in his nine-decade 'life of learning'. Not only was communications research the vehicle through which he and Lazarsfeld initially forged their famous partnership, it also helped Merton advance his own sociological thinking and yielded some of the best work on mass media published before 1950. Following the logic of the idea of serendipity, I trace the development of Merton's communications research from his unplanned preparation in the 1930s, through the structured opportunity he ambivalently embraced working with Lazarsfeld during the war, and on to some of the more significant consequences that followed.},

For this reason, many scholars working in this literature see McLuhan as a man of the left. Although there is a discernible anti-capitalistic politics in McLuhan's works, this article will argue against the position that his anti-capitalism is rooted in leftism. Indeed, McLuhan critiques the liberal, individualistic and capitalistic print age from the right-wing side of the political spectrum. McLuhan's writings on tribalism reveal the hope that a new right-wing postmodern community will be reconstructed. Such a retrieval of the past is postmodern, since technology and myth are the forces which, McLuhan hoped, would construct this new right-wing political space.},

This study extends our understanding of Alpert in two main ways: first, by examining the earlier development of his views and career. Beginning with his 1939 biography of Emile Durkheim, we explore the early development of Alpert's views about foundational questions concerning the scientific status of sociology and social science more generally, proper social science methodology, the practical value of social science, the academic institutionalisation of sociology, and the unity-of-science viewpoint. Second, this paper illuminates Alpert's complex involvement with certain tensions in mid-century US social science that were themselves linked to major transformations in national science policy, public patronage, and unequal relations between the social and natural sciences. We show that Alpert's views about the intellectual foundations, practical relevance, and institutional standing of the social sciences were, in some important respects, at odds with his NSF policy work. Although remembered as a quantitative evangelist and advocate for the unity-of-science viewpoint, Alpert was in fact an urbane critic of natural-science envy, social scientific certainty, and what he saw as excessive devotion to quantitative methods.},

Early work on television fame originated from film studies, or was generally defined against the concept of film stardom. This meant that it was often characterised negatively: the apparent specificities or qualities of TV fame were defined in pejorative terms, and it was imagined in terms of what it was not (film stardom proper). The subsequent expansion of celebrity studies has arguably placed less emphasis on the specificity of media forms and boundaries \textendash{} in part reflecting the fluid and pervasive circulation of contemporary media fame. We suggest here that this has created a conceptual context in which the real complexities of TV fame have fallen between the analytical cracks.

  abstract = {This book offers the first detailed intellectual history of communication study, from its beginnings in late nineteenth-century critiques of corporate capitalism and the burgeoning American wireline communications industry, to contemporary information theory and poststructuralist accounts of communicative activity. Schiller identifies a problematic split between manual and intellectual labor that outlasts each of the field's major conceptual departures, and from this vital perspective builds a rigorous critical survey of work aiming to understand the nexus of media, ideology, and information in a society. Looking closely at the thought of John Dewey, C. Wright Mills, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Daniel Bell, and others, Schiller carefully maps the transformation of ideas about communication and culture as issues of corporate power, mass persuasion, cultural imperialism, and information expansion succeed one another in prominence. Bringing his analysis of communication theory into the present, Schiller concludes by limning a unitary model of society's cultural/informational production, one that broadens the concept of "labor" to include all forms of human self-activity. Powerful, challenging, and original, Theorizing Communication: A History offers a brilliantly constructed overview of the history of communication study, and will interest scholars working in the field as well as those working in critical theory, cultural studies, and twentieth-century intellectual history.},

Results reveal Asia as a popular site for the robust TPE research (41 articles focused on Asia). The most popular topics in Asia were pornography and news about social events. The results further indicate that survey was the most used method in TPE research conducted in Asia. In addition, U.S.-based authors dominated the overall TPE research.

These preconceptions have been challenged by subsequent research and theory. More recently, however, the ongoing transformation of the means of communication may have rendered the whole mass communication paradigm itself obsolescent, and with it the concept of a mass audience.

Three interrelated questions will be addressed: first, Lowenthal's preparation for his work at the Institute for Social Research in Frankfurt; then the Institute's transfer to Columbia and Lowenthal's role in developing a sociology of literature and popular culture; and finally, the implications of Lowenthal's mentorship of Katz at the beginning of his scholarly career.},

Ritual communication is no longer seen as a static concept counterposed for all time to a '' transmission'' view of communication, but rather as an independent, dynamic and increasingly deromanticized perspective on our contemporary media experience. The former emphasis on its idealized religious and ceremonial origins has given way to an acknowledgment of its complicated and ambiguous social role. While ritual has traditionally been perceived as uniting communities by reflecting and establishing shared meanings, Elihu Katz, Daniel Dayan, Eric Rothenbuhler and James Carey have enriched the concept with notions of power, authority and control.},

Topic modeling reveals a high diversity from the early years on. Only a few journals show the tendency to focus on one topic only, whereas most outlets cover a broad variety and thus represent the field as a whole. Although our discipline is strongly interconnected with the changing media landscape, results show that communication research is characterized by high consistency.

Academic discussions on CCI have grown extensively after the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) identified 13 sectors as constituting creative industries in the UK in 1998. The public has also become gradually convinced of the significance of CCI as being important for economic growth. We adopt a systematic and quantitative method to review the academic CCI literature. After collecting data, we first investigate the research fields under which the journals that publish CCI papers are categorized, finding that Business, Economics and Geography are the top three research fields. A second examination on the authors' nationality indicates that their cultural background induces a different emphasis on their research field. We lastly apply the multiple main paths analysis to uncover the development trajectories of CCI research, with the result showing that the research agenda has changed along with a better understanding of the essential elements of CCI. Based on the literature on the main path, we observe the top five discussed themes: information technology, global cooperation, micro and fragmentary creative activities, remote places, and country/regional characteristics. Monitoring the discussions on these themes may help CCI researchers, creative workers, and policy makers to assess future directions for economic development.},

The subsequent rise of a creative industries discourse \textendash{} in the United Kingdom and beyond \textendash{} had a transformative effect on those progressive claims, not least in bringing to the fore a more economistic, capital-driven model of urban renewal which served to undermine many of the promises that had been invested in popular urban culture under social democracy. How this shift was played out in the academic literature \textendash{} and its political consequences \textendash{} is the theme of the remainder of the article. This article forms part of the Special Issue 'On the Move', which marks the 20th anniversary of the European Journal of Cultural Studies. It also heads up a special online dossier on 'Creative Industries in the European Journal of Cultural Studies'.},

  abstract = {This paper investigates the unique educational relevancy of Walter Benjamin's radio broadcasts. While much has been written about Benjamin's approach to both children's literature and children's theatre, his own pedagogical practice as a radio pedagogue remains largely marginalized in these discussions. In order to address this gap in the literature, I focus on the implications of shifting from the largely visual world of children (celebrated in color illustrations) to the auditory world of radio. Through a careful reading of the radio scripts, I argue that a perceptual alteration unique to the sonic medium of radio jumpstarts historical thinking in children. The following pedagogical principles which I extract from the radio broadcasts support and enhance this mode of historical materialist education. In conclusion, the article argues for the ongoing relevancy of Benjamin for thinking through the pedagogical implications of new information technologies within a postmodern era such as podcasts.},

Books and literature present only a special case of mechanical reproduction, according to Benjamin, but the implications of this point remain largely unexplored by scholars. The purpose of this essay is to ask why Benjamin would have considered print to be different or less historically consequential compared to photography and cinema when the revolutionary potential he ascribes to these more recent technologies is also prefigured in his other writings on books and literature. Answering this question helps to create a sharper picture of what matters to Benjamin about new media and also points to figures like Georg Luk{\'a}cs who influenced Benjamin's account of technology and art. Ultimately, this line of questioning also raises concerns about the place of the '' Work of Art'' essay in the study of media history, a field in which the signal error is to treat new media as unprecedented developments.},

  abstract = {In 1924, when American broadcasting was less than four years old, editor Bruce Bliven concluded that forecasts of the transformative effects of the new medium had been vastly overdone.1 Radio would not guarantee world peace, generate a global language, or enable every person on the planet to "have instantaneous communication with every other," as breathless visionaries had foretold. In fact, said Bliven, radio did not even figure to improve education or expose the public to new ideas. One reason was the control of broadcasting by commercial interests that were determined to make it "an organ of orthodoxy." But a more fundamental reason lay in the nature of the new medium. Inflated expectations of radio's power had arisen from the assumption that radio listeners would exhibit the restlessness and suggestibility that mark the psychology of people in crowds. Bliven pointed out, however, that the radio audience differed fundamentally from a crowd; it consisted of listeners distinguished more by their passive aloneness than by their excitable togetherness. Thus broadcasting had little capacity to serve the ends of demagogic politicians. Radio could touch the millions, Bliven suggested, but it could budge them in only trivial ways.},

It argues that the emerging phenomenon of '' amusing ourselves to death'' in China is fundamentally different from the phenomenon of '' amusing ourselves to death'' in the United States and that this difference has been masked by the decontextualized mechanical application of Western cultural theories, an increasingly common practice in Chinese cultural studies. In fact, Chinese-style '' amusing ourselves to death'' is a combination of George Orwell's Big Brother and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as well as a product of Chinese post-totalitarianism or, in other words, of advanced totalitarianism. As such, it resembles neither a totalitarian culture of the Stalinist model nor an American-style '' amusing ourselves to death,'' but rather a new culture that combines totalitarianism and consumerism and that calls for theoretical innovations and reconstructions in cultural studies.},

In the mid-19th century, and ideal of the press as an `educational' agency predominated; the press should involve readers in a public discussion that contributed to self-government. As the electorate and reading public expanded, this ideal began to decline and give way to an ideal of the press as `representing' the people. In this formulation, the ordinary reader was not credited with rational thinking, and instead of involving readers in a public discussion, this theory proposed that newspapers should speak for the readers.},

Recent work has endeavored to reveal the social and psychological influences that give rise to gratification-seeking and to locate gratification-seeking in its natural context of media attitudes and behaviors that collectively shape the effects of media exposure. In the future, uses and gratifications research is likely to continue to expand its horizons and to contribute to related approaches to media and audiences, but fundamental political, theoretical, and methodological differences will prevent an alliance with the new ethnographic approaches to critical and cultural audience studies.},

Articles published in Behaviour \& Information Technology have reflected these changes. Some research topics have attracted continuing interest throughout this period, and two are reviewed briefly: the effect of network delays on users and the relative effectiveness of different media and user choices between them. In addition, many new technical and theoretical developments have been reported. Two major theoretical trends have been the convergence between behavioral research in telecommunications and computing and the rise in social science-based research. The question of whether published behavioral research has been able to influence the development of the technologies studied is considered.

This dimension is central to pragmatist perspectives on the formation and functioning of publics and I propose that we reconstruct pragmatism as a tradition of communication theory in light of this fact. First, I reexamine the historical emergence of pragmatism in communication theory and I suggest James Carey was unable to challenge positivism or objectivism from within a pragmatist tradition. Second, I retrieve John Dewey's account of inquiry in a manner anticipating its implications for his theory of publics. Third, I resituate the Dewey\textendash{}Lippmann debate within the context of a pragmatist tradition to demonstrate how deeply their differences turn on problem formulation. In conclusion, I connect the pragmatist tradition to contemporary work on problematization to address the limitations of each perspective.},

  title = {'{{Communication}}' in the {{Making}} of {{Academic Communication}}},
  abstract = {The disciplinary status of communication study (academic communication) has remained a point of contention among scholars, largely for paucity of systematic information on the field's historical institutionalization. The process of gaining academic legitimacy through the granting of doctorates has been complex and often confusing. It involved a variety of labels, departmental sponsorships and resistances, and personal ambitions. This study sought to trace these paths from their identifiable beginnings through the 1980s and thus to contribute to the discussion about and further development of the field. Using a multi-method approach (quantitative content analysis, case histories, career trajectory analysis), this study tracked\textendash{}through the word communication\textendash{}the field's natural history from its early linguistic manifestations through its crystallizations in structures and roles. It is composed in three parts. Part I, an analysis of the word communication in the Journalism Quarterly, 1924-1949, presents communication study as emerging from the search by journalism for academic legitimacy. This search went through stages, representing shifts in conceptualizing communication and codified in key phrases\textendash{}news communication, mass communication, communication research. The "communication research" phase of thinking, in the 1940s, provided the immediate context for the major institutional changes that would accommodate communication study. Part II gives an account of the establishment of the communication Ph.D. and structures for study and research (research centers, institute, department, college) in five pioneering universities (Universities of Iowa, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois, and Michigan State). Part III, based on interviews with thirty-two selected communication scholars, describes the emergence of a new professional group and discerns patterns in the career trajectories of its members, some of whom became communication scholars by academic employment (the "Settlers" group), others by doctoral training ("New Stock"). The convergence of the popularity of the communication label, of the necessary institutional changes to accommodate the research-oriented label and the people who made it possible, create historic opportunities for major developments in the field. These changes establish the pattern of institutionalization and the progress toward legitimate claim to offer a Ph.D.},

It makes that case by reconstructing persistent political economic dimensions in the work of Charles Horton Cooley, who more than anyone else de-serves to be called the intellectual founder of communication study in the U.S. Drawing out previously neglected aspects of Cooley's thought, it sketches how his pragmatist, social democratic brand of political economics took a holis-tic, historically informed view of the communicative constitution and social or-ganization of selves, institutions, and political cultures. Cooley provides a starting point for a revised understanding of the history of political economic thinking about communication and ways that it has intersected with sociology, cultural study, and democratic theory},

Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} A historical, cultural approach is used to examine published and unpublished writings of economists, marketers, researchers, and publishers from the 1880s to about 1930. The primary focus is Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies' Home Journal, and creator of one of the first market research departments in the USA. Findings \textendash{} The argument is made that publishers and advertisers took the values of a republic, values which has long empowered and idealized white property owners, and redefined those values in terms of buying ability. In doing so, they embed many biases in their market research, yet gave businesses a working concept of the consumer and helped shape society's ideals of the consumer. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} As with all historical research, it is limited by the primary sources that have survived and are available. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper shows how early market research can provide an important perspective into the making of a consumer society, and how it can be used by historians and current practitioners to understand the methods, biases, and assumptions that have guided marketers and market research.},

In recognizing the feminist influence in the development of cultural studies, it is also important to acknowledge that this implicates feminism in an approach that often overcompensates for traditional Marxism's determinism and neglect of cultural experience by ignoring the structural constraints imposed by political and economic realities. This article traces the developments between feminism and Marxism and cultural studies and political economy, suggesting that the answer to the problem of separate spheres is not to populate one sphere at the expense of the other. Rather, what is needed is a feminist political economy that reconciles the insights of '' the politics of representing the Other'' with a much-needed material dimension that only a political economy approach can provide.},

The article intends to review the context and nature of critical media and communication studies, seen through the author's personal experience in national as well as international spheres. While the testimony is autobiographical, an attempt is made to contemplate career development from the outside unlike in conventional memoires. This article is a prelude to a reflective review of the author's professional and political life story, forthcoming as a book in Finnish. The introduction gives examples of the use of the term '' critical'' in the field of media and communication studies, followed by a review of different ways in which the critical concept is used in the literature of the field, leading to a reflection on the precarious relationship between the intellectual and the political. A personal testimony by the author then provides a case illustrating how a scholar becomes critical under the influence of philosophical, political and international factors. The discussion at the end offers some concluding reflections.},

But even given this nascence, there have been significant shifts in the ways that it has theorized, studied and investigated fans over the first two and a half decades of research. As scholarship, fan studies has moved away from ethnographic investigations of fans as the main object of study to focus instead on the output of fan discourse as the key mode of examination. At the same time, scholars like Henry Jenkins and Matt Hills, both central to the discipline, have opened dialogue about the nature of the fan/academic, often called the `aca-fan'. This article uses the lens of aca-fandom to analyse fan answers to interview questions at a large Midwestern Doctor Who convention. Fans were asked about the role that fan studies has played in their life, how they perceive the study of fans and whether fan studies as an academic discipline has an effect on their fandom. The fans' answers reflect a critical awareness of fandom but a general ignorance of fan studies. This article argues three points to take away from this. First, fan studies needs to refocus attention back onto fans themselves through ethnographic work. Second, the discipline needs to refocus its output less on esoteric academic titles and more on popular venues. Finally, fans and academics should engage in specific dialogue to open up avenues for new fannish and academic exploration.},

Focusing on the treatment of the disembodied voice by various theorists, three trends can be identified: borrowing from semiology and narratology, an essentially descriptive approach first emerges that creates a new vocabulary to talk about sound and analyze the links between sound and image. A second approach emphasizes the possible meanings of the disembodied voice, a trend heavily influenced by Lacanian theories and their later adaptations by feminist film theorists. Finally, some researchers have opted for semio-pragmatic or cognitive approaches that take into account the experience of audiences. These different approaches underline the way film sound has evolved as an object of study, to be considered as a complex and flexible phenomenon. They also have developed tools that can be applied to other audiovisual media in which the role of sound and the voice should not be underestimated.},

Williams sought to distinguish questions of technique and technical invention from their realization in the fundamentally social organization of technologies themselves and emphasized the importance of agency and intention in structuring the uses to which technologies are put. Far from technology having an inescapable internal logic of development, innovation takes place within specific social and economic contexts. For Williams, this meant that there was no pre-determined outcome to the evolution of communications innovations but a series of complex interactions between innovations and the world into which they emerge. This article will provide an assessment of Williams' work on technological innovation, his critique of determinism and his commitment to democratic communications. Williams helps us to challenge the simplistic proposition that 'the Internet has changed our world' and enables us to understand instead the ways in which contemporary social relations set limits on the development of the Internet as a democratic medium.},

  abstract = {This essay asserts that it is impossible to understand any communicative utterance outside the context in which it is uttered. Within this context, I expound a conception of communication based on ideas in information theory and on Niklas Luhmann's systems theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the context dependency of utterances. At the same time, I introduce readers to Luhmann's version of systems theory, which is becoming more and more influential in German literary theory. The view of communication expounded here implies that as all meaning is founded on difference, an utterance can acquire meaning only by differing from other utterances, that is, by negating other positions. Therefore, the context is always part of the utterance; it enters, so to speak, into the utterance. At issue here is a specific type of context, a specific axis of difference, correlated with the utterance in a particular way. I try to show exactly how this specific conceptualization of the relation between meaning and context, between communication and difference, is to be understood. First, I discuss the systems theoretical concept of communication and illustrate it with several examples taken largely from political and literary communication. Next, I address the way this concept of communication and difference diverges from (post)structuralist theories, to which it might seem to bear some resemblance. Finally, I examine the difficult question of the relationship between communicative utterances, contexts, and their place within social systems, focusing especially on Luhmann's conceptualization of the art system.},

In recent decades, the amount of scientific research related to gender and advertising has increased.

For this purpose, we carried out a systematic review of 215 articles published in English and Spanish between 1988 and 2010 and included in seven national and international databases. Our results show that, despite an increase in the amount of research, the different elements of the advertising communication process have not been studied to the same degree and also that a variety of techniques have been used to measure sexism. Moreover, information about the instruments and measurements used in these studies is incomplete.},

  abstract = {Main characteristics, challenges, current practices and future directions of mass communication research are examined from a sociology of science perspective to determine the influence of theory, method and utility to government and industry decision makers on the development of future directions of research activity in this field. Intellectual underpinnings for theory, method and utility for mass communication research activity are traced through the more established social sciences which from the 1930s through the 1960s were based on fairly stable pragmatist and behavioral assumptions. However, by the 1970s when anticipated theories and procedures of this orientation had not gone unchallenged alternate philosophies and research approaches with new perspectives on the purposes of social science research began to receive greater attention from North American scholars. Mass communication, distinctly American social science which developed during the era of stability, had by the 1970s also experienced the repercussions of challenge and disaffection with a positivist, behavioral research orientation. The degree to which challenges have affected mainstream research activity by the 1980s is examined from the perspective of the influence of funding, sponsorship arrangements and university setting. Nine hypotheses concerning the impact of institutional structures on research activity and researcher perspectives on the field are tested through survey techniques. Nominal data was gathered relative to the recent past, present, and planned future research activity of mass communication researchers affiliated with major and minor American universities. Statistical analysis using Chi-Square provided partial confirmation for the research hypotheses which posit a disassociation between the primary research activity of scholars and what they perceive as the most relevant approaches and areas for research innovation in the field. Developed as a service oriented field, mass communication research appears to continue following the original directions for research activity. However, researchers also seem to be aware and concerned about the limitations of the research agenda and supportive of developing theories, procedures and structures for more actively pursuing alternate approaches to research activity.},

As a communicative phenomenon and research object, social media would appear to be in flux. Changes to existing services, the emergence of new services, and the disappearance of previously popular services testify to the sense of social media as a moving target. Researchers of social media seem to accept change, rather than continuity, as a condition for the study of social media. This is evident in our choice of research topics and data sources, but also in our discourses on social media. By examining the sense of flux of social media research in a historical perspective, this article aims to provide useful directions for future media and communication research on social media.

Drawing on his letters to the Corinthians and other early groups of Christ-followers, I argue that Paul used eloquent mediated rhetoric to conceptualize local ritual practice in such a way that it could form the basis for widespread solidarity and mass community in a geographically expanding religious sect. This was a form of mass communication centered in dispersed bodily assemblies and radiating outward to encompass ever wider regions of a distended mass society. It hinged on the Body of Christ, which in Paul's letters became a space- and time-binding medium of mass communication that held together a dispersed society of the Christ-proclaiming faithful. Paul was essentially an early medium theorist, and I argue that his bifocal attention to local assembly and distant solidarity is instructive for both the study and social practices of mass communication today.},

There was almost nothing at that time on the number of readers of a magazine or even the number of people that got a magazine. What happened then was that the publishers would issue what they call "publishers' statements of circulation." The trouble was that sometimes those statements consisted only of the number of copies printed. Answering to a question related to the problems and issues that the research community is facing today, he said that one of the greatest problems is the completion rate in surveying, particularly with the probability sampling method in which call-backs are required. The completion rate has gone down. It's becoming much more difficult to get interviews.},

In the first part of the essay, I account for the preoccupations of South African cultural studies from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. In the second part, I reflect on further shifts since 2000. Here I argue for a politics of the emergent, an increasing turn towards the negotiation of the possible, the drawing in of trans-national frames, and the reformulation of theories of race in the aftermath of resistance politics. Studies of popular culture during this period increasingly come to be superseded by a focus on public culture and on circulation. The essay concludes by considering current contests in cultural studies in South Africa and with a reflection on its current place within a reconstituted public intellectual space.},

Specifically, the analyses indicated that the level of education, part-time/full-time commitment, and the type of university are the most influential factors in defining both the prevalence of a professional culture and the lack of research productivity. These findings support other international studies, indicating a global tendency across key variables that influence academic development in the field.

However, relatively little attention has been paid by media researchers to Goffman's own theoretical work on the mass media. Taking its lead from the later work of Goffman, this essay shows how it contains elements of a theoretical framework for mass-mediated communication, through the concepts of ?hyper-ritualization? and ?dramatic scriptings.? I emphasize the way that Goffman situates mass communication in relation to the interpersonal realm as a model version of the latter, as mass communication is crafted, concentrated, and planned to a degree that interpersonal communication is not. I conclude that Goffman's critical approach to informality in broadcast talk and interaction is a valuable tool for the researcher in a time when the rhetoric of informality has become a dominant mode of legitimation in broadcasting.},

We urge a broader educational commitment to the professionalism of scholarship, as opposed to the more conventional view of media professionalism in the academy increasingly promoted by the media industry. Meanwhile, the academic communication field\textendash{}the prevailing disciplinary identity of journalism\textendash{}has emphasized media effects and audience studies. As universities seek greater external financial support, this research is easily directed toward applied, or administrative, research, leaving broader questions of journalism and democracy up for grabs. Our view of academic professionalism is based on a broader social responsibility, and we are concerned that the educational mission should not be dictated by external agendas. While journalism in some ways occupies an academic no man's land, accepted by neither industry nor more traditional liberal arts disciplines, it can be viewed alternatively as a potentially fruitful academic intersection, providing leadership in educational reform.},

Ray Heisey (1932\textendash{}2011) was exceptionally well regarded both by professional colleagues and former students as an early promoter of the academic field of intercultural communication, with a lifelong commitment to the inherent value of dialogic communication at all levels of teaching and research. He was remembered as '' a dedicated scholar,'' '' a generous soul,'' as a '' mentor, and model,'' '' extremely kind to international students,'' '' a great educator'' who '' practiced what he preached in his life,'' and as Wenshan Jia eugulized him: '' Ray's professional life as an intercultural scholar, intercultural education, and intercultural practitioner was a unique success because he had integrated these three principles in his daily professional life'' (Jia, 2011, May). One of Heisey's major contributions was his advocacy of the dialogic approach to the teaching, study, and research in intercultural communication, a constant over his professional life and highlighted both in his leadership of Damavand College in Tehran and his exchange programs, teaching, and research related to China. On campus when the March 4, 1970 shootings occurred at Kent State University, he reflected well on this event. This important contribution led to his high level of interest in peace and conflict management and resolution, as seen both in his research on such conflict in the Middle East and the Soviet Union. Deeply spiritual, much of his research related to religion in communication, women's rights, and peace issues. Visiting China eleven times, and teaching there for two semesters, his series editorship of '' Advances in Communication and Culture,'' following his co-editorship with Wenxiang Gong, saw the publication of five more books relating to Chinese communication, all of which enhanced the intercultural understanding of China. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Professor D.

  title = {Do the {{Social Sciences Create Phenomena}}? {{The Example}} of {{Public Opinion Research}}},
  volume = {50},
  abstract = {This paper is an investigation into the philosophy and the history of the social sciences. Some philosophers of the social sciences have suggested that a key feature of the natural sciences is their capacity to create phenomena, and that the social sciences do not meet this criterion. We suggest, to the contrary, that the social sciences can and do create phenomena, in the sense of new ways of describing and acting that have been used to produce all sorts of effects. Like the natural sciences, the social sciences create their phenomena through the procedures that are established to discover them. But the creation of phenomena is a complex, technically difficult and contested process and its success rare. Historically, this argument is developed through a case-study of the development and evolution of public opinion research in the USA and Britain. We argue that by the 1950s public opinion produced a version of the world that had entered 'into the true'. Special attention is given to technical considerations in the development of public opinion research, especially the genealogy of a particular research technology, that of the representative sample. Whilst we are not concerned with demarcation criteria, we argue that there are some important differences between the social and the natural sciences; that the former have a less concentrated 'spatial mix' and a slower 'tempo of creativity'. None the less, in this particular case, the social sciences have played a key role in the creation of opinioned persons and an opinionated society.},

Compared with digital PR research before 2008, we find that 1) social media have become a major research topic while remaining a secondary concern of many PR practitioners; 2) digital PR studies are gradually shifting from description to theorization; 3) the examined studies witnessed a general trend of methodological diversification but this trend needs to continue in order for scholars to better describe, predict, and explain how digital PR should be organized and practiced; and 4) digital PR research frameworks are dominated by the organizational perspective, whereas increasing attention has been paid to organizations in the nonprofit sector. Compared to digital PR research before 2008, our findings suggest that the development of digital technology in recent years has brought about changes in PR research such that the research paradigm is presently shifting and acts as a competing paradigm but has not yet shifted completely.},

If we return historicity to the relationship of classical pragmatism and communication, and if we develop a fuller understanding of the distinctive aspects of pragmatist theories of inquiry, we can better understand the contributions of John Dewey and Walter Lippmann to a novel conception of democracy as problem-solving. In this way, we recover what is distinctive about pragmatist approaches to democracy and acquire a more differentiated sense of politics that refuses to reduce classical pragmatist writing to deliberative or dialogic conceptions of democracy.

A decade later, many researchers have answered the call, with several defining studies examining the social and psychological influences on risk communication. This article reviews risk communication research appearing in the published literature since 1996. Among studies, social trust, the social amplification of risk framework, and the affect heuristic figured prominently. Also common were studies examining the influence of risk in the mass media. Among these were content analyses of media coverage of risk, as well as investigations of possible effects resulting from coverage. The use of mental models was a dominant method for developing risk message content. Other studies examined the use of risk comparisons, narratives, and visuals in the production of risk messages. Research also examined how providing information about a risk's severity, social norms, and efficacy influenced communication behaviors and intentions to follow risk reduction measures. Methods for conducting public outreach in health risk communication rounded out the literature.},

In 1929 the Council appointed a committee, including Paul Cherington as chairman, himself and two or three others, to plan to establish a national marketing organization. The only national association then existing was the Association of Teachers of Marketing and Advertising, established around 1914 or 1915. The basic, original purpose in organizing the Market Research Council, fifty years ago, was to bring together in closer association the men who held and followed the high ideals of scientific research and work.

Based on the so-called double periphery \textendash{} the peripheral location of Argentine sociology in the western social sciences, but also of cultural research within local sociology \textendash{} the author seeks to analyze the emergence of this subdiscipline. It owes to both the concern for mass culture and its relationship with populism at the end of the 1960s. At that time, these studies were being done by researchers with training in literary criticism, researchers who approached cultural phenomena as a political concern, in a way similar to what occurred when British cultural studies were born. At the end of Argentina's last dictatorship (1976\textendash{}1983), the reappearance and growth of a sociology of culture expanded into Nomadic terrains and into varied themes and institutions: this was due to a proliferation of studies in social communication and new university departments, but it can also be attributed to the influence of Brazilian anthropology. Another factor is the delayed creation of graduate programs and their clearly multidisciplinary nature. Today the field is testing its potential while undergoing both quantitative and qualitative growth. However, it is essential to re-examine the field's sociological aspects as it moves along this path.},

He argues that cultural studies has been questioning the relationship between meaning and power in everyday life through a variety of concrete and practical fields. In fact, he argues, it is inevitable for cultural studies to ask questions about the politics, if we in cultural studies are to develop actual knowledge of cultural production and consumption today. Hence, it is essential to investigate the micro-politics of bodies in relation to macro-political processes. In the case of Japan, working on cultural studies within an existing discipline also means engaging in experiments, which ultimately could have the potential to undermine existing disciplines from within.},

The field's general flexibility appeals both to many established researchers, who employ its methodologies to expand the scope of their investigations, and to many students, who become frustrated with disciplinary rigidity and with the difficulty in carrying out academic projects with overtly political underpinnings from the traditional disciplines of the humanities and social sciences. While student demand is clearly strong in much of Latin America, the response to the rise of Cultural Studies in the Latin American academy has taken two general forms: (1) an opening up of spaces within existing disciplines (anthropology, communications, literature, etc.) for the more interdisciplinary or politicized work and (2) the foundation of new programmes in Cultural Studies. We use as examples the case studies of Argentina and Colombia, countries that have a completely different academic history and tradition. We survey the diverse ways in which Cultural Studies has entered institutional spaces in both countries. Colombia offers the case of an academy that appears to have welcomed the institutionalization of Cultural Studies, at least superficially, while Argentina appears to have resisted ceding the field institutional space. Nonetheless, its presence in both countries is strongly palpable; it is clearly a force too strong to be suppressed by resistance from the traditional disciplines.},

  volume = {12},
  abstract = {This article reviews recent debates regarding the disciplinary status of cultural studies. In doing so, it takes issue with the tendency for cultural studies to fight shy of characterizing itself as a discipline. This involves an examination of the respects in which, especially in Australia, cultural studies has now acquired all the institutional trappings of a discipline. It is suggested that those perspectives which view the institutionalization of cultural studies as tantamount to its co-option rest on a misreading of its earlier history and of its relations to the education system. In terms of its intellectual characteristics, it is suggested that cultural studies is distinguished by a number of traits regarding its approaches to the analysis of the role of culture in relations of power and subjectivity. It is these qualities, it is argued, that have allowed cultural studies to play a more general role as an interdisciplinary 'clearing-house' within the humanities. The article concludes by considering the qualities that have most distinguished Australian cultural studies, placing the stress on its strong feminist orientations, its contributions to our understanding of the relations between culture and nation, and its role in connecting cultural studies to the concerns of cultural policy.},

On the one hand there is a strong academ-ic interest in how cultural studies perceives and analyzes media culture, popular culture and everyday life. On the other hand boundaries with humanities and so-cial science remain, which leads to criticism and conflicts with cultural studies and its achievements. I will discuss some of the problems concerning the perception and reception of cultural studies among representatives of Kulturwissenschaft(en) and sociology of culture.

It contrasts the political economy school with cultural studies. The positions of Herbert Schiller and Armand Mattelart on the `resistance debate' are outlined, with the author concluding that while Schiller still asserts the validity of cultural imperialism thinking, Mattelart has moved in a slightly different direction. Nonetheless, while the latter has welcomed the departure from monolithic research models, he by no means endorses cultural studies positions, particularly their political implications. The article also contrasts the way `resistance' has been used by postmodernists in the field of communications with its meaning as articulated by two prominent writers in the field of comparative literature: Edward Said and Ngugi Wa Thiong'o. Both writers still validate the notion of cultural imperialism and use the term `resistance' to refer to the struggles against colonialism and imperialism in the countries of the South.},

Despite this, for the last 30 years the group has been the object of a diffuse and often gratuitous campaign of ridicule and misrepresentation. The authors of this misrepresentation first caricature the group, labelling it a band of Marxist conspiracy theorists, then blame the group for alienating journalists and retarding the cause of media research. This article presents evidence of this misrepresentation and then offers an apologia for the GUMG, in the now archaic sense that to apologize is to defend. It specifically seeks to explode some of the enduring myths that have gathered around the GUMG and its work.

As computers became ubiquitous in businesses, homes, and schools, there was increasing concern about computer anxiety and its effect on individuals. The first academic articles on computer anxiety were published in the early 1980s. Since that time, hundreds of papers have been published on the topic. Yet, up to this time, no one has done a comprehensive review of computer anxiety. In this article, 276 articles on computer anxiety are reviewed. From a synthesis of the articles and variables studied to date, a framework is developed that outlines the primary topics studied in computer anxiety literature. Nine antecedents, five correlates, and two outcomes of computer anxiety are identified as the most studied variables in the literature. In addition, a statistical comparison is done to compare the distribution of computer anxiety topics and results published in the 1990s to those published in the 2000s.

There are different internal and external (societal and political) means which influenced the development of communication studies and theories in each of the two countries. The Sciences de l'information et de la communication (SIC) gained their academic acceptance in France in 1975 which under international comparison was late. One strong external moment of the instutionalization of SIC was the political aim to modernize the French University for the so called 'information society'. The French researchers developed their own focus. Semio-pragmatics and social constructivism are two basic theoretical orientations which, after the end of the limiting structuralistic paradigm of the 1960ths, lead to a fruitful connection of the analysis of the micro and the meso-level of communication processes. Thus, Pragmatics and Symbolic Interactionism played an important role in French SIC much earlier than in Germany.},

The essay argues that all communication theories are mutually relevant when addressed to a practical lifeworld in which '' communication'' is already a richly meaningful term. Each tradition of communication theory derives from and appeals rhetorically to certain commonplace beliefs about communication while challenging other beliefs. The complementarities and tensions among traditions generate a theoretical metadiscourse that intersects with and potentially informs the ongoing practical metadiscourse in society. In a tentative scheme of the field, rhetorical, semiotic, phenomenological, cybernetic, socio-psychological, sociocultural, and critical traditions of communication theory are distinguished by characteristic ways of defining communication and problems of communication, metadiscursive vocabularies, and metadiscursive commonplaces that they appeal to and challenge. Topoi for argumentation across traditions are suggested and implications for theoretical work and disciplinary practice in the field are considered.},

In general, this work aims to reflect on the state of communication theory as a social and humanistic science, in those democratic countries from the first world which incorporated the study of communication theory in their universities in the 1970s, based on an observation of the Spanish situation. Consequently, the issues analysed, the epistemological precept and the solutions proposed can be extrapolated to all those zones where the discipline is currently in a complete phase of consolidation, definition and maturity.},

  abstract = {In 1946, after visiting Russia, Harold Innis remarked that the time had come to broaden the range of political economy by studying, first, the struggle for social supremacy between states, churches and commerce; and, second, the related competition between languages, religions, cultures and communications media. This, I argue, is what Innis accomplished. His early studies of Canadian economic history transcended conventional economics and laid the groundwork for a later political theory of communications. It expressly took up the 1946 challenge to address competing monopolies of knowledge and power, hence manipulating the space and time-binding properties of communications media. Innis' work reflected a materialist model of communications, a social ecology, a soft determinism or philosophic naturalism and it linked knowledge, freedom and power. Finally, I conclude, these insights permitted Innis to transcend bias and to search for a balanced culture. /// En 1946, apr{\`e}s avoir visit{\'e} la Russie, Harold Innis remarqua que le temps {\'e}tait venu d'{\'e}tendre l'{\'e}tude de l'{\'e}conomie politique {\`a} l'analyse de la lutte pour la supr{\'e}matie sociale entre les {\'e}tats, les {\'e}glises et le commerce, ainsi que la comp{\'e}tition qui y est reli{\'e}e entre les langues, les religions, les cultures et les m{\'e}dias de communication.

It is shown that as a field of study political communication has tended to ignore historical methods and sensibilities. This tendency is traced to the field's roots in social psychology, political science, and early mass communication research. However, although political communication tends to ignore historical research, it often depends upon implicit, unquestioned historical narratives. Thus, a more robust historical imagination is encouraged not only because it may produce more and better historical research, but also because it may assist in the development of tools for reflecting on the way political communication already deploys historical narratives.},

Independent work was, however, carried out elsewhere. In Germany, Hermann Schmidt introduced the notion of Allgemeine Regelungskunde [general control theory] in the early 1940s, which bore many similarities to the almost exactly contemporary work of Wiener and colleagues. Schmidt's work was subsequently largely neglected during the rapid post-war dissemination of cybernetics ideas until it was, to a certain extent, rediscovered in Germany in the 1960s. There Schmidt is often credited, alongside Wiener, as one of the two 'fathers' of cybernetics.

  abstract = {In an essay on French literature in the period of Nazi occupation, Herbert Marcuse argues that a literature of intimacy\textemdash{}love poems and romantic novels\textemdash{}is the last resort of freedom in totalitarian conditions. Written in 1945 and revised in the 1970s, Marcuse's essay argues that in the face of totalitarianism, a literature of intimacy opens a realm of human experience that is outside the control of the regime. Because it carries a memory of joy, it is radically other to the ethos of the regime. Later, in The Aesthetic Dimension (1978), Marcuse returns to the role of aesthetics when political change is unlikely to occur. The article revisits Marcuse's 1945 essay and his reading of the poetry of Charles Baudelaire and Paul Eluard. It begins by relating Marcuse's interest in love poetry to the work of other critical theorists who see a radical role for aesthetics and the pursuit of happiness in periods when political change is blocked. It examines the 1945 essay, puts it in context of Marcuse's work for the US intelligence services in the 1940s, and looks at the similarities between the 1945 essay and Marcuse's later writing. Finally, it asks whether Marcuse's arguments matter today (as the dreams for which the New Left of the 1960s went in search appear as remote as ever).},

  abstract = {'Cultural Studies' as an academic phenomenon has shown extraordinary growth expanding to universities throughout the English-speaking, settler colonies of Great Britain since first finding an institutional home in England at the University of Birmingham in 1963. Either departments bearing the new name were brought into being or specialties within existing departments declared themselves. This study situates the early success of cultural studies in the short-term conjuncture of the First (British) New Left which advanced 'culture' as an explanatory category in the midst of the upheavals of the mid-1950's as both mainstream and Marxist frameworks proved inadequate, and secondly, in the longer-term trend (since the controversy occasioned by the French Revolution) of conservative social criticism on the part of the literary intelligentsia. Part I is concerned with the determinate conditions of the emergence of the collection of political/intellectual issues which came to be known as cultural studies as a function of social time, that is the post-1945 Kondratieff expansion and the cycle of British hegemony and its passage to the United States. The development of work at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies\textendash{}its characteristic national mode and concern for theory, and the substantive areas of media studies, subcultures, ethnography, the working class, and race and gender\textendash{}is traced in Part II. The major efforts are allowed to 'speak for themselves', then the shape that cultural studies took in its migrations is examined. Part III is concerned with the trajectory of Cultural Studies through conjunctural space as the long-term structures of knowledge/power begin to break-up with the general onset of systemic fluctuations announcing the eminent demise and transformation of the Modern World-System. The post-1945 world (and the world of knowledge) ordered by the East-West competition of blocs/ideologies gives way to a world structured by the North-South clash of identities/subjectivities in which even science, guarantor of truth and summit of the disciplinary hierarchy, begins to question its own position from within.},

One hundred seventy-five articles published in major communication journals from 1991 to 2011 were extracted as crisis communication articles. The results of a quantitative content analysis revealed that, among theories applied to crisis research, most were from communication and public relations disciplines, which included framing, image restoration, situational crisis communication, and excellence theory. Although outside disciplines that have studied crisis communication research included psychology, economics, mathematics, and sociology, those disciplines made up less than one-third of the articles. Regarding the methodological approach, each portion of articles using two or more methods (e.g., experiment and survey) and a triangulation approach (e.g., qualitative and quantitative) was less than 10\%. However, the frequency of the triangulation, or mixed-method, approach has dramatically increased since 2006, which indicates that interdisciplinary crisis communication research is evolving into an interdisciplinary field. Another indication of this trend can be found in the variety of authors, institutions, and departments dedicated to crisis communication. Although crisis articles are published primarily by communication, journalism, and public relations departments, other diverse disciplines are also widely contributing to crisis communication research.},

His analyses of particular media are commonly viewed simply as instances of his broader account of how space- and time-binding media serve to bias societies and civilizations. This paper argues that Innis' generalizations about media derived, in fact, from his examination of how a particular cluster of media \textendash{} namely, printing and publishing, with particular reference to newspapers \textendash{} was linked to the onset of modernity. These concerns were evident in his magisterial unpublished manuscript, History of Communication. Drawing on its periodization and overarching themes, this paper examines Innis' account of the newspaper industry as it developed between the American Revolution and the mid-point of the twentieth century. The historical trajectory that Innis traces, it is argued, reveals the specific concerns about printing and modernity that underpinned his general reflections about time- and space-binding communications},

First, this work elaborates the challenge to the theory and practice of liberal democracy that Laswell presented through his application of a naturalistic political science. Secondly, it considers his response to the problematic character of democracy as both a practicable and desirable form of political rule. This study begins by outlining the anti-democratic implications of both the methodological standpoint and derived findings of an early naturalist behavioral science of politics. Having defined the general context of this investigation, this work then focuses on the logic and ramifications of Lasswell's approach to the study of political behavior. Through a consideration of his application of several different analytical frameworks and perspectives, this study shows that his research culminated in a set of findings which debunked many of the fundamental tenets underlying democratic liberalism. This work then discusses how Lasswell addressed the problematic character of democracy as a desirable and practicable form of political rule. First, it shows that underlying his commitment to a democratic social order was the conviction that such a polity was most suited to the development of a psychologically sound and healthy human society. Secondly, it considers the specific palliative that he prescribed for the ills of 'democratic statecraft.' This study concludes by highlighting the potentially anti-democratic and anti-liberal implications of Lasswell's call to constrain a politics of irrationalism by subjecting it to a set of rationalist principles derived through a form of democratic technology.},

His study of Canadian natural resources, in conjunction with transportation systems, taught him to see empire as a pattern of flow. With his staples research programme exhausted, morally driven by issues of war and peace, and concerned by the social power of publishing, he followed newsprint into the marketplace of the big American newspaper. From there Innis investigated publishing technologies back to their origins in time. Conceptually and methodologically, Innis's inquiry into communications media was a parallel replication of the systematic historical method he employed to study staple economies. Harold Innis followed staples into communications where he came to recognize that, whether by the example of beaver pelts or by the example of advertising, he had always been studying the flow of media through empire and civilization.},

Journalism studies goes beyond the training and education of journalists to encompass scholarly inquiry into journalism. Much teaching of journalism within universities is now conducted by journalists who have switched to the academy and become known as 'hackademics'. This article explores the extent to which such journalists-turned-journalism-educators also contribute to a deeper understanding of journalism by engaging in scholarly research. It is based on an empirical study of 65 hackademics in the United Kingdom and Ireland, whose experiences of academic research into journalism will be discussed within the context of the international literature.},

For several decades Publizistikwissenschaft had considered itself as one of the humanities. But at the beginning of the 1960s, a scientific debate started about the discipline's subjects, its methods and tasks. The forum for this debate was in the scholarly journal Publizistik. This article identifies the arguments and rhetorical repertoires employed by two scholars from opposite sides of the debate, Emil Dovifat and Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, to convince the scientific community to side respectively with either the social science or the humanities camp. It is shown that an array of arguments were utilized, from the political meanings and ethical aspects of media, to epistemological reasoning. Furthermore, it is surprising to see how dramatic and emotional the rhetorical repertoires were.

  abstract = {Research on framing is characterized by theoretical and empirical vagueness. This is due, in part, to the lack of a commonly shared theoretical model underlying framing research. Conceptual problems translate into operational problems, limiting the comparability of instruments and results. In this paper I systematize the fragmented approaches to framing in political communication and integrate them into a comprehensive model. I classify previous approaches to framing research along two dimensions: the type of frame examined (media frames vs. audience frames) and the way frames are operationalized (independent variable or dependent variable). I develop a process model of framing, identifying four key processes that should be addressed in future research: frame building, frame setting, individual-level processes of framing, and a feedback loop from audiences to journalists.},

According to the author, the journal is fortunate in having an oral historical record of interviews of pioneers who explored the unknown history of advertising research. According to the author, he had the privilege of meeting with and interviewing seven of the legendary practitioners of advertising research: Henry Brenner, Archibald Crossley, Ernest Dichter, George Gallup, Alfred Politz, Frank Stanton, and Hans Ziesel. The resulting interviews ranged from twenty minutes to forty minutes in length. His short-term purpose was to cut these down to a half-hour segment which would give a sense of the points of view and personalities of the seven pioneers. The true value of these interviews is that they represent oral history. According to the author, although his acquaintance with most of these pioneers of advertising research began with these interviews, he feels that he knows each of them very well because they gave so freely of themselves and their most profound thoughts about research in the course of these discussions.},

Then the disciplinary nature of the field is discussed, with special reference to the ongoing reform of higher education in Europe known as the '' Bologna process.'' An illustrative case is provided by a survey of the field in the Scandinavian countries. The conclusion is that there is a need for radical reflection about the discipline in the contemporary world, calling for an approach to media studies in terms of the philosophy of science. The article presents notes for further thought rather than suggests final scenarios, and this is done from an admittedly personal and national perspective \textendash{} as a veteran of the field and as a member of the Finnish community.},

Radical and structuralist feminist communication scholars, however, tend to focus exclusively on texts and often ignore important contextual considerations. I conclude that socialist feminism offers the greatest potential for a comprehensive framework to address women's devaluation in communication but that much more theoretical and empirical work still needs to be done. Finally, I encourage the recent tendency among feminist communication scholars to ignore disciplinary boundaries and draw freely on literary, film, and speech studies, as well as mass communication and feminist theory.},

Given contemporary concerns with both deliberative democracy and affect theory, rhetoricians and speech teachers would benefit today from a fuller understanding of some of the undemocratic ideas that influenced the modern rhetorical renaissance.

Keith Rayner's extraordinary scientific career revolutionized the field of reading research and had a major impact on almost all areas of cognitive psychology. In this article, we review some of his most significant contributions. We begin with Rayner's research on eye movement control, including the development of paradigms for answering questions about the perceptual span and its relationship to attention, reading experience, and linguistic variables. From there we proceed to lexical processing, where we summarize Rayner's work on effects of word frequency, length, predictability, and the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Next, we turn to syntactic and discourse processing, covering the well-known garden-path model of parsing and briefly reviewing studies of pronoun resolution and inferencing. The next section shifts from language to visual cognition and reviews research which makes use of eye movement techniques to investigate object and scene processing. Next, we summarize Rayner and colleagues' approach to computational modeling, with a description of the E-Z Reader model linking attention and lexical processing to eye movement control. The final section discusses the issues Rayner and his colleagues were focused on most recently and considers how Rayner's legacy will continue into the future.},

Although these ideas are usually attributed to McLuhan, who wrote about them in two important books, The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) and Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1965), Hall had considerable influence in their development. Although Harold Innis is widely acknowledged for shaping McLuhan as a communication technological determinist, the exchange between Hall and McLuhan helped develop the latter's theory about the impacts of communication technology on the human senses.

Walter Thompson ?made sense* from the standpoint of the actors involved. At the time Watson joined the agency, he had achieved a national reputation as a psychologist, a researcher, and the leader of behaviorist psychology. His doctrine, which recognized prediction and control as the goal of psychology, meshed well not only with broader Progressive concerns of social control, but more particularly with the goals of the business community, and at J. Walter Thompson, with the goals of Stanley B. Resor. Watson's presence at the agency became a *mechanism* through which Resor could implement his philosophy into advertising practice. Watson's work was to help rationalize the advertising process, but at the same time, spoke directly to the admirers of science, legitimating a reality in which decision making based upon *scientific* methods assumed a role of prominence.},

Reading Deleuze's comments on, and references to, phenomenology in the cinema books (especially Merleau-Ponty, Laffay, and Dufrenne), this paper argues that while not following a phenomenological logic in general, at certain moments the cinema books' Bergsonian account intersects with phenomenology. Moreover, in the books, the existence of movement-images in the cinema depends on the spectator's experience of watching films. The logic explaining this encounter is indebted to the account of the experience of art and cinema in phenomenology which Deleuze combines with the discussion of 'real' movements in Bergson's Creative Evolution. This reliance on a specific 'passive' viewer's experience can explain the books' limited interest in early cinema and in television, video, and the digital image.},

Yet, the political and academic history and the contexts of the emergence of cultural studies and 'Kulturwissenschaften', as well as their by now established academic traditions and the manifold relations to current developments, are rarely defined and scrutinized. In this paper,we will relate some theoretical and historical perspectives concerning the relationship between cultural studies and the historical disciplines in the German-speaking context. We shall try to trace the potential of mutual benefits between cultural studies and history by foregrounding the political commitment of academic work that still seems to be one of the most important traits of CS as much as the necessity of a stronger notion of the contextualization that history and historiographical methodology provides.},

Then, on the basis of Mulvey's latest book, Death 24\texttimes{} a Second, and of a variety of contemporary examples, the emphasis is on the relative shift in Mulvey's work from gender to time and visual technology. Finally, the conversation focuses on the concept of 'gendered scopic regime' and the potential re-articulation of the male gaze through the technological re-direction and control of the visual.},

Against the common identification of the project of classical film theory with commitment to essentialist notions of medium specificity, the article demonstrates the theorists' concern with intermedial issues of exchanges between film and other media. Drawing on examples from the engagement with the newly emergent medium of radio in canonical texts by the three theorists, the article discusses the influence of radio on theorizing about the unique properties of film, its aesthetic possibilities, and course of development. The article finally argues that the vast dynamic changes in the mediascape of the 1920s and 1930s, which saw the coming of sound film, the emergence of radio, and the first demonstrations of television technology, necessitated classical film theorists to adopt intermedial perspectives similar to those that are commonplace in today's writings on digital cinema and new media.},

This article first provides an overview of Innis's two main fields, his staples thesis of Canadian economic development, and media thesis as it concerns world history. This section also relates the media thesis to contemporary media and dependency theories and postmodernist discourses. The second focus of the article is on Innis's critical analysis of press systems. The discussion not only integrates his staples and media theses, buy also extrapolates Innis's analysis to the present to show the deep concerns he would express regarding the present-mindedness of contemporary media and culture. Throughout there is an emphasis on Innis's materialist understanding of culture and social relations.},

  abstract = {This paper examines the origins of the institutional organization and advocacy strategies that later culminated in American public broadcasting. Previous to the Communications Act of 1934, which privatized American broadcasting, educational radio lacked standards for best practices and functioned in a decentralized and localized form. After the Act, the Office of Education (OOE) took interest in radio as a medium to expand federal initiatives related to educational ?public forums,? town-hall style meetings centered around community debate. Noting the lack of noncommercial channels in which to broadcast forums to a larger audience, the OOE began to collaborate with the National Association of Educational Broadcasters (NAEB) to lobby the FCC, while producing civic programming with commercial broadcasters. Instead of fighting the regulation, the OOE and NAEB founded an advocacy approach centered on creating an alternate broadcasting infrastructure as a way to address regulatory precedents. In this process, early forms of production, distribution, and infrastructure later associated with public broadcasting were devised out of a hybrid of commercial broadcasting aesthetics and federal educational bureaucracy. Contrary to the received view, discussion of the origins of American public broadcasting must be framed as advocacy to change the national system through strategies of research, collaboration, and governmental incorporation instead of resistance.},

Concepts in titles of papers presented to the Division were analyzed for trends over a 21-year period. Cluster analysis was used to classify concepts on the basis of their linear trend, variability in trend, and annual frequency. Six clusters of trends emerged from the analysis. The content of the increasing clusters, contrasted with decreasing clusters, suggests movement toward the study of cognitive concepts and away from behavioral studies. The analysis also indicates a trend toward theory-driven research that examines the general processes of communication and away from more media-focused examinations that concentrate on specific systems, media, or technologies.},

By ?theory of ethnography?; I refer to the set of theoretical propositions used to define ?what is ethnography?;, both by Hymes and other anthropologists. The paper will first set a contrast between two major variations in Hymes? writing on the subject. An explanation will then be suggested for what appears to be a shift in Hymes? concerns. Finally, a few questions will be raised about the pertinence of Hymes? present position.},

Significantly, although Huxley's target was Stalinism when he wrote the novel, revisiting Brave New World forces one to reflect on contemporary, democratic versions of totalitarianism as well. And yet Huxley himself did not follow the political and ethical consequences of his critique. The article seeks to map these consequences by rethinking the maxims of the brave new world in relation to three main themes: biopolitics, nihilism and network society. Indeed, seen through this conceptual prism, there is a remarkable homology between Huxley's Brave New World and our world.},

This critical narrative reveals that the technocooperativity of the culture market demands that Cultural Studies leave aside knowledge of the negativity of the splitted, the errant and the lost. It corresponds to art and literature, to critical thinking, to reintroduce ? in a minor key ? the disorders of the unclassifiable in the world of the classified and the classifier. Only with the critical play of disobedient languages against the university technomarket can the resigned homology between the politics of governability, the administration of the social, the industrialization of the cultural and the professionalization of useful knowledge be bankrupted.},

Wright Mills's efforts to deconstruct unacknowledged power structures in the United States and his comprehensive critique of academia remain absent from the general curriculum. This is partly because Mills never pretended academic work wasn't personal; his texts pay witness to the struggles of a man who used the written word to come to terms with himself. Mills aimed to grasp it all, to make individual troubles accessible by redefining them into social issues; he failed as much as he succeeded. I make Mills a comrade on my own intellectual journey and argue that rereading Mills allows young critical scholars to rethink current social theory and their own place within it.

Together, these liberating practices enable scholars to include themselves and their experiences in explaining why and how they perform their intellectual work.

His general interests range from intercultural communication, rhetoric, media and public communication to Africana studies. He has taught at several universities, led several organizations and is recognized as a leader within the communication discipline and in the broader national and global society; especially within Africa and the African diaspora. Asante is credited with the development and eventual emergence of what is referred to as the Afrocentric Idea, a theoretical perspective focusing on the agency of African peoples. Asante's groundbreaking work in the 1970s and 1980s would foreshadow and frame many of the debates of not only communication studies, but in the fields of education, sociology, literary, and cultural studies, as well as history from the 1990s and early twenty first century. The current article focuses on Asante's important contributions to intercultural communication in the areas of rhetoric, media and public communication, Africana Studies, and intercultural/interracial communication. Asante's emergence corresponded with the American multiracial struggle against domestic racism and segregation; and the international fight against imperialism and advanced stages of colonialism. Many of Asante's ideas reflect the spirit of the 1955 Bandung conference that helped launch intellectual and political opposition to oppression by people of color. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The psychological, social, and physical processes of human communication. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A communication exchange between multiple cultures. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The influence of media technology, politics, and consumer behavior. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} An analysis of the social, linguistic, and conditions of discourse. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The transgenerational and transcontinental study of Africans. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A theory of social change.},

Secondly, this article will discuss the reasons to introduce the thought of Caillois in the current debate, showing compatibility between his theories and contemporary reflections, suggesting the possibility to use them to understand gamification, by observing the long-term analogies between games and societies and the role performed by mimicry.},

Communications studies, journalism studies, media studies and cultural studies programmes have all developed over the last two decades, but in an institution-specific manner. The tensions embedded in some of these ad hoc arrangements \textendash{} tensions not necessarily confined to these disciplines but often implicit in any merger between critical theory and professional practice \textendash{} boiled over in a series of newspaper articles by journalism educator Keith Windschuttle in 1998 which attacked the use of cultural and media studies in journalism programmes. A one-day conference was held in November 1998 specifically to debate the relationship between journalism educators and cultural studies academics. This review essay outlines some of the lessons to be learned from the 'Media Wars' conference, before defending the value of developing specific areas of common ground \textendash{} both in the academy and in public debates about the function of the media \textendash{} between the two disciplinary fields.},

Properly understood, confidence is a communal process, 'faith-together.' Though typically blamed for encouraging cynicism, mass media also have a very basic tendency to generate public confidence. Status conferral embeds the social objects portrayed by media in webs of value and thus recommends those objects as grounds for public confidence. At the same time, as empirical work has shown, some forms of news undo the work of status conferal and generate cynicism instead, I end by examining distinct structures of civil society that may determine the contours of mediated confidence and cynicism.},

  title = {Media {{Policy Paradigm Shifts}}},
  volume = {18},
  abstract = {This article deals with communications and media policy paradigms. In the US and Western Europe three paradigmatic phases of communications and media policy may be distinguished: the paradigm of emerging communications industry policy (until the Second World War); the paradigm of public service media policy (1945-1980/90); and the current phase (from 1980/90 onwards) in which a new policy paradigm is searched for. In Phase I, communications and media policy primarily referred to the emerging technologies of telegraph, telephony and wireless. Communications policy in that era was mainly pursued for reasons of state interest and financial corporate benefits. After the Second World War, media policy was dominated by sociopolitical rather than economic or national strategic concerns. In this paradigmatic phase, lasting until 1980/90, the ideal of public service broadcasting was at its height, notably in Western Europe. From 1980 onwards, however, technological, economic and social trends fundamentally changed the context of media policy. In many countries, governments opted for policies of breaking monopolies in media and communications and privatizing as much as possible. The old normative media policies have been challenged and policy-makers are searching for a new communications policy paradigm. In this new paradigm, there seems to be a shift in the balance of component political, social and economic values that shape the definition of the public interest that media and communications supposedly serve. The authors conclude by sketching the core principles of the new communications policy paradigm that currently seems to be emerging.},

I argue that the media effects tradition was born into a milieu that was exclusively sided with the nurture (environmental determinist) position and has largely remained so. Within the past 20 years, there have been advances in neurophysiology leading other disciplines to theorize that human behavior is the result of the interaction between nature (genetics, brain physiology) and nurture (learning, culture). In this article, I sample the media effects research emerging from this perspective and argue why this approach is superior to the learning-only approach currently popular in the field of communication. I then discuss the implications of such an approach for communication researchers, framing the critique in terms of the contribution to mass communication theory building.},

The concept of evolution creates a theoretical framework for studying the history of media and suggests new concepts and questions about media extinction, survival, and coevolution. The concept of interface focuses on the media, subject, and social interactions. Finally, the analysis of media hybridizations is basic for understanding the appearance of new media that combine different devices, languages, and functions.},

Methods Semi-structured qualitative interviews, based in part on the 'Life-Line' and 'Time-line' techniques developed by Dervin and her collaborators. Participants were purposefully sampled to reflect a range of experience levels and conceptual approaches.. Analysis The study adopted an inductive approach to data analysis, based on the 'constant comparison' approach of Glaser and Strauss. Feedback from participants was sought throughout the analysis process via email. Results 'Interactions and Relationships' describes the social contacts involved in their construction of the author; 'The Role of Existing Constructions' deals with participants' existing knowledge and understandings; and 'Accepted and Contested Constructions' demonstrates how they drew on their existing constructions in order to accept or contest the constructions of the author conveyed to them Conclusions Participants' constructive processes involved drawing on their previous experience ('existing constructions') in order to accept or contest the constructions of the author conveyed to them in each new encounter. Participants' constructive processes had two interdependent aspects: the construction of meaning and the construction of authority.},

After a brief history of the emergence of the field, we review the record of published research in books and journals during the past 5 years, identifying major strains of theory, key issues, and topical categories. We then apply the strains of thought to classify papers presented at the ICA conferences, noting patterns and shifts across and within ICA divisions and interest groups. Based on these patterns, as well as on informal input from colleagues, we map the discipline formation of visual studies and identify trends in institutional development. We conclude by exploring future directions for the field now that the visual interest group has grown to become the Visual Studies Division of ICA.},

Results revealed an increasing productivity especially from Asia-based scholars and the popularity on topics concerning public diplomacy. The analysis also indicated that most articles were theory-driven and survey was the most frequently used method. Experimentation and advanced statistical analyses have been gaining momentum as well. Implications of these findings were discussed with the goal to shed some light on the trends and directions of this maturing discipline in a continent with emerging economies and growing global influence.},

Tracing the development of this Committee points to the progress brought about by women journalism educators as they strove to gain a voice in national affairs.

After 1945, one of his major efforts was to re-establish contacts that had been lost because of the war. Gazette, the international journal that he founded in 1955, was intended to serve these different purposes. Since then Gazette has continued to act as a liaison centre for research and researchers from different parts of the world.

Finally, there is a lengthy discussion of a few other areas of significance that reveals Apel's conceptual relationship to theories of communication. The first of these areas or fields consists of the way in which Apel takes up hermeneutics. The second is his definition and use of the '' self-recuperative principle'' while the third consists of his ongoing conversations with social philosophers J{\"u}rgen Habermas and Enrique Dussel.},

Personal experiences as a founding member of the Centre are drawn on to explore the evolution of CS's methodology and its analytical dissection of racism in English culture. It is shown that CS's difficulty in analyzing race lies in the absences and displacement with which Western culture simultaneously perpetuates and dissimulates racial meanings, and positions subjects. The mission of CS, it is concluded, is to mobilize its intellectual resources to understand the differences that lie at the core of our cultures and ourselves.},

I argue that these approaches have indirectly silenced a much longer disciplinary history outside '' the West'' that has not only produced empirical knowledge but has also actively challenged Western epistemologies. This article seeks to reinscribe the epistemological and historical foundations of media and communication studies in Africa. By framing the research of African media and communication scholars within the changing nature of knowledge production, shifting power relations between African nations, and the evolving role of African universities, I demonstrate how academic knowledge production is frequently driven and constrained by particular dominant social, political, and economic interests.},

Groundwork for the proposed cultural studies programme began in a series of discussions held by an interdisciplinary group of faculty about how to create the opportunity for structured graduate teaching, advising and research in cultural studies at UC Davis. The Dean of Graduate Studies at that time encouraged this group to submit a pre-proposal for an MA and Ph.D. in cultural studies. Faculty involved in the original discussions subsequently drew up a pre-proposal and held further informal meetings. E-mail lists were created and information was disseminated. Eventually, an executive committee, whose charge it was to draw up a formal proposal, was formed. The following proposal grew out of the executive committee's early efforts. Cultural studies at UC Davis cuts across myriad units, programmes, clusters and centres in two colleges in the humanities, social sciences, and agricultural environmental studies and involves a unique collectivity of faculty and students interested in class, gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, transnationalism, postcolonialism and related areas of enquiry. The UC Davis proposal, therefore, forges many connections across a wide variety of cultural studies interests.},

  volume = {5},
  abstract = {Purpose - In the annals of marketing history and the history of marketing thought, there is a key figure whose influence from the mid-twentieth century through to the present day is worthy of note, Dr Ernest Dichter. The purpose of this paper is to place Dichter's writings in appropriate context and posit that arguably more insight into this charismatic figure can be discerned by taking greater account of the Cold War (1946-1991) climate in which he was working and writing. Design/methodology/approach - This paper is best thought of as an example of biographically inflected research. The paper focuses on the "socially progressive" aspect of his writings in order to display Dichter's support for the American economic system in the Cold War climate of the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. The author highlights how Dichter came to the attention of the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the mid-1950s. What this paper underscores above and beyond all those that have explored aspects of Dichter's life is that his character was interpreted by respondents to FBI questioning in ways that reflected geopolitical circumstance. Findings - Some of those interviewed by the Bureau praised him highly, whilst others labelled him a Communist, and accused his organisation of employing people with similar leanings. While Dichter may have had some limited associations with socialist doctrines in his early youth, such accusations were misplaced. But, overall, what this paper highlights is a highly malleable practitioner whose practices and writings both contributed to the society in which they were disseminated, but also shifted with the circumstances in which they circulated. Originality/value - This paper adds an important dimension to the biography of Ernest Dichter which has not previously been explored.},

Elaborating on how the Kuhnian paradigm-in-crisis model does not accurately describe the current state of mass communication research, this article discusses the role that the time-honored media effects narrative plays in the discipline, positive aspects of Lang's vision, and conceptual issues to consider in efforts to theorize about the constantly-changing communication environment.},

Furthering Leeds-Hurwitz (2010) frame for analyzing people, places, and ideas in each decade, L{\"o}blich and Scheu's (2010) model is applied and extended to consider six domains for profiling a field: (\#1) people\textemdash{}the biographies of influencers, (\#2) places\textemdash{}their institutions/networks, (\#3) ideas\textemdash{}their intellectual propositions, (\#4) events\textemdash{}influential gatherings and associations, (\#5) times\textemdash{}influential periods, paradigms, Zeitgeist, and (\#6) contexts\textemdash{}multiple levels of other situated influences. The proposed six analysis areas seek to adopt 0065, 0070 and 0075 for examining the intersections of social history for a discipline, especially one as interdisciplinary in its origins and applications as intercultural communication (IC). Each is applied with proposals and starting profile suggestions for carrying out multimodal mapping of the intercultural fields. Two other potential frames are also considered: a possible (\#7) behavior\textemdash{}the personal/social applications of the field (e.g., to intercultural training), and (\#8) consequences\textemdash{}the social impacts and responses to the field. A '' who's who'' list of post-1970s '' second generation'' influencers is integrated with each of the categories with recommendations toward future poly-profiling and field analysis for both US American and intercultural disciplinary expressions in other nations or contexts. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Applies a sociology of knowledge and Bourdieu's analysis of science to intercultural fields. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Applies agent, habitus, capital, field and organizational analysis to disciplinary development. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Extends social histories that profile people, places and ideas to add events, times and contexts. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Provides a who's who list of post-1970s intercultural influencers for future poly-profiling. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Maps people profiles from multiple institutional, intellectual, and other overlapping domains.},

  abstract = {Harold Adams Innis (1894-1952) and Herbert Marshall McLuhan (1911- ), as encyclopedic weavers of perception, are the proper parents of Canadian intellectual history and communications study. Despite their respective specialized backgrounds in political economy and English literature, Innis and McLuhan approached the inter-disciplinary terra incognita of 'communications' during World War II and the immediate years which followed. Having chosen the antithetical academic traditions of Cambridge University humanities and the University of Chicago social sciences, the two thinkers first published contrary philosophies in The Dalhousie Review of 1936. More than a decade later the young Professor McLuhan was to request from Dean Innis a grant to cover publishing fees. By 1948 the two explorers were to converge upon each other and upon the same subject matter\textendash{}advertising and newspapers\textendash{}from differing political, academic, and religious views. Despite the infrequency of their discussion and correspondence, each man's thinking was significantly influenced by his colleague. A number of important Toronto academics joined Innis and McLuhan in the interdisciplinary 'Values Group' seminars of 1949. Following Innis' death in 1952, McLuhan uniquely treated Innis' major themes and interpolated a synthesis of other thinkers with his own topical perceptions. The boyhood backgrounds of Innis and McLuhan reveal striking similarities such as talented and industrious mothers and fundamentalists values. Yet the outstanding differences in age, disposition, experience, and method render these 'two men on a collision course' most unlikely co-creators. Innis' hidden tradition of dialectics, as opposed to McLuhan's chosen tradition of rhetorical grammar, posits the primacy of materialism, realism, and empiricism. McLuhan, conversely, must be understood within the tradition of spiritual, satirical, and oratorical aesthetics. The multi-disciplinary methodology of each man is unique. Nevertheless, there exists sufficient parallel between the two appoaches to speak of an Innis-McLuhan effect in popular thinking. The themes and appoaches common to Innis and McLuhan make possible a new understanding of specialized fields: Chapter Ten offers a streamlined model of how such a perspective might be applied to the study of drama and cinema. The underlying biases of Innis and McLuhan are part truth and part opinion. Men create technology and not technology men. Nevertheless, the staples thesis of Innis, transformed by McLuhan into 'the medium is the message,' has numerous valuable implications and applications. In Chapters One and Two, mere appetizers, the 'unknown' personalities of Innis and McLuhan as informal human beings behind their more formal images are introduced. In Chapters Three and Four, their formative years of training are placed within the larger context of Canadian cultural change and global technological transformation. The contributions of Innis and McLuhan to their fields of specialty are simplified in Chapters Four and Five. In Chapters Five and Six the actual Innis-McLuhan collision and the birth of communications studies are introduced while in Chapter Seven McLuhan's debt to Innis and independent development in the 1960's is explored. Chapter Eight is essentially a condensation of and commentary upon the thought of Harold Innis as is Chapter Nine a cataloging and clarifying of McLuhan's dominant probes. The summary chapter provides a scrutiny of the implications, applications, and veracity of each man's thought.},

  abstract = {In the early 1980s Perth was probably the most important city in Australia for Cultural Studies. Through that decade many intellectuals who became leaders in Australian Cultural Studies and important players in Cultural Studies outside of Australia worked in Perth. Among them were John Fiske, John Frow, John Hartley, Tom O'Regan, Lesley Stern, Graeme Turner and, a decade later, Ien Ang. This essay discusses the presence of these academics in Perth and advances some reasons why Perth became so important to Cultural Studies in Australia. It also discusses the kind of Cultural Studies that became privileged in Perth and considers some of the reasons for this. Perth Cultural Studies in the 1980s was primarily text-based and focused on screen-related popular culture, especially television programs and popular film. Cultural Studies in Perth developed in a city thought of as marginal to Australia, in institutions that were either not universities or, in the case of Murdoch University, was a very new university, by cosmopolitan academics who mostly came from either elsewhere in Australia or from the United Kingdom.},

However, scholarship has varied considerably in its treatment of this concept. Through a review of 320 publications from 15 of the communication field's journals from 1976 to 2015, we systematically cataloged how perspective-taking has been conceptualized and operationalized. Our analysis identified five relatively independent research traditions addressing this construct. We discuss the conceptual issues raised by this review, and propose an integrative definition of perspective-taking that seeks to address them. We conclude with conceptual and operational recommendations for researchers interested in perspective-taking, highlighting potential areas of investigation that communication scholars are uniquely positioned to explore.},

One of the central contradictions of the Decatur Study is that it simultaneously disguises that it is women who are being studied here yet universalizes them as representative of the general population.

Through time, a design methodology has emerged to guide the creation of simulation games to improve communication in complex policy decision environments. These instruments are not intended to be predictive; rather, their primary objective is to help a group achieve consensus through the multilogue mode of communication.

  title = {Operative {{Media Archaeology}}: {{Wolfgang Ernst}}'s {{Materialist Media Diagrammatics}}},
  volume = {28},
  abstract = {Media archaeological methods for extending the lifetime of new media into 'old media' have experienced a revival during the past years. In recent media theory, a new context for a debate surrounding media archaeology is emerging. So far media archaeology has been articulated together with such a heterogeneous bunch of theorists as Erkki Huhtamo, Siegfried Zielinski, Thomas Elsaesser and to a certain extent Friedrich Kittler. However, debates surrounding media archaeology as a method seem to be taking it forward not only as a subdiscipline of (media) history, but increasingly into what will be introduced as materialist media diagrammatics. This article maps some recent media archaeological waves in German media theory. The text addresses Wolfgang Ernst's mode of media archaeology and his provocative accounts on how to rethink media archaeology as a fresh way of looking into the use and remediation of media history as a material monument instead of a historical narrative and as a recent media theoretical wave from Germany that seems to not only replicate Kittler's huge impact in the field of materialist media studies but develop that in novel directions. However, as will be argued towards the end, Ernst's provocative take that hopes to distinguish itself as a Berlin brand of media theory in its hardware materiality and time-critical focus resonates strongly with some of the recent new directions coming from US media studies, namely in software and platform studies.},

Ong is most widely known for his orality\textendash{}literacy scholarship, we do well to bear in mind that his most advanced formal training was in literary studies. From early on in these studies, the figure he wrote about and continued to write about throughout his life was the poet, and fellow Jesuit, Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ong was drawn to Hopkins in large part for the bearing of his writing on the evolution of human consciousness. Ong discovered in his Master's thesis on Hopkins' sprung rhythm \textendash{} written under Marshall McLuhan \textendash{} that Hopkins was in some sense hearing in advance the sounds of what would become twentieth-century modernism. Hopkins displayed a sensibility and awareness that were compelling for the modernist writers of the twentieth century, as they carried out their experiments with finding new voices, new ways of writing poetry for the changed world in which they found themselves. Hopkins' feel for the distinctive self, seeking connection with other selves in the uncertainties of time, played no small role in this appeal. Ong's work on Hopkins is a model for both literary criticism and studies in the evolution of consciousness.},

The paper addresses this convergence-within-divergence by comparing how policy discourses have conceptualised popular culture in the two countries. It investigates the hypothesis that, in both, an engagement with popular culture has in fact been an important driver of change, albeit at different times and with different taxonomies.

The five primary findings reveal that: 1) publication of new media research continues to diffuse, with the subfield likely to have reached a critical mass and passed through an adoption 'take off' phase; 2) authors favor a concentrated set of title keyword terms to describe their research; 3) media-oriented journals publish approximately half of all new media articles; 4) a core set of 14 communication-related journals currently publishes new media research; and 5) the principles of mediamorphosis and diffusion of innovations help to explain the emergence of the new media concentration within the communication discipline.

The divide has been institutionalized over time in the structures of academic departments and schools, professional training and degrees, scholarly societies and publishing, and in the field's larger research agendas. However, critics inside and outside the field have long insisted that the differences between the two subfields actually obscure the shifting, contingent nature of communication in everyday experience, social formations, and culture. This paper traces efforts to theorize the intersection of interpersonal and media communication, and in particular the concept of mediation, from Lazarsfeld and Katz's two-step flow in the 1950s, to the challenge of digital media technologies in the 1970s and 1980s, to the rise of new media studies and digital culture scholarship from the 1990s onward.},

  abstract = {The principal aim of this study is to offer an historical reconstruction of the genesis of radical cultural studies. In practice this project has entailed the construction of a progressively-written account of the intellectual development of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies from the time of its establishment in 1964 and, especially, during the period of the politicisation of its project from the historical conjuncture of 1968 onwards through to the mid-1970s. Integral to the realising of this aim has been the development of an interpretation of the Centre's radical project as having constituted a counter-intellectual critique; that is, and interrelated ensemble of delegitimating, legitimating and reflexive critiques. It will be shown that this interpretation emerges from the Centre's intellectual history over the periods of its development considered and that, in retrospect, it can be discerned in the terms in which the Centre critically transformed its own project. The study begins with a critical consideration of two reconstructive approaches to cultural studies\textendash{}those of historical reconstruction and reconstructive critique. After this point of departure attention is immediately focussed on the originating formulation and the initial reception of the Birmingham Centre's project. This is followed by a chapter devoted to the critical practice of its founder Richard Hoggart. Two chapters on the Centre's engagement with sociology then ensue and this leads to a consideration of the radicalisation of its project which emphasises the turn towards Marxism that it involved. Next the elements of a reconstructive critique of radical cultural studies are presented using the components of a counter-intellectual critique theoretically constructed for this purpose conjoined with a perspective on three kinds of knowledge-constitutive interests. A brief discussion on the derivation and use of the term counter culture is also given. Lastly the study reconsiders reconstructive approaches to cultural studies with special reference to the topic of deep interpretation. The study ends with some reflections on cultural studies and its 'shadow'.},

  volume = {38},
  abstract = {In this article, we trace the emergence of film criticism in Australia, from the period of its first appearance in the 1920s to its formalisation in the academy in the 1970s. Through an examination of trade, fan, newspaper and journal publications, we identify along the way four significant moments when broader industrial, public and institutional configurations gave rise to different kinds of film criticism: an 'independent commentary moment' (the 1920s), a 'film as film moment' (1930s), a 'film appreciation moment' (1950s\textendash{}1960s) and a 'production principle moment' (1970s). Each attended to some new way of taking up and being with film and is associated with its own particular array of practices. This historical trajectory of film criticism was characterised by increasing complexity and variety. Rather than replacing or displacing existing forms, each new form of film criticism built upon existing forms, produced new layerings and relations among critical forms. Using Bennett's [Making Culture, Changing Society (Abingdon, 2013), 125.] perspectives on the relation between culture and government, we identify film criticism as a form of expertise for adjudicating films and guiding their uptake. In this way, we show film criticism as being shaped not only by the shifting priorities of film and the film world, but also by broader contingencies of media, education and public culture. This lens reveals an important Australian difference when compared to the US, Britain and continental Europe: the Australian uptake of a film-as-film aesthetics in longer form film writing and reviewing is very much a response to and a consequence of the coming of sound rather than of the late silent period. We end with some remarks on the contribution this national trajectory of film reviewing made to the formation of film writing in the Australian academy and to the revival of Australian film-making, which both began in earnest in the 1970s.},

In the process, I argue (a) that while Dewey largely failed to reconcile his democratic ideal with the empirical constraint of large-scale organizations, Habermas, in particular his work on the public sphere, provides an important starting point for considering the state of public participation within the communication distortions of advanced capitalism; (b) that to fully understand the relation between communication distortions and public participation, social theorists must look beyond Habermas and return to Dewey to mobilize his bi-level view of habitual and reflective human agency; and, finally, (c) that the perspective of a Deweyan political theory of reflective agency best furthers our understanding of potential communication distortions and public participation, particularly in the empirical spaces of media centralization and intellectual property rights.},

  abstract = {The Cybernetic Apparatus: Media, Liberalism, and the Reform of the Human Sciences examines efforts to reform the human sciences through new forms of technical media. It demonstrates how nineteenth-century political ideals shaped mid-twentieth-century programs for cybernetic research and global science sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation. Through archival research and textual analysis, it reconstructs how and why new media, especially digital technologies, were understood as part of a neutral and impartial apparatus for transcending disciplinary, ethnic, regional, and economic differences. The result is a new account of the role of new media technologies in facilitating international and interdisciplinary collaboration (and critique) in the latter half of the twentieth century. Chapter one examines how political conceptions of communications and technology in the United States in the nineteenth century conditioned the understanding and deployment of media in the twentieth century, arguing that American liberals conceived of technical media as part of a neutral apparatus for overcoming ethnic, geographic, and economic difference in the rapidly expanding nation. Chapter two examines the development of new media instruments as technologies for reforming the natural and human sciences from the 1910s through the 1940s, with particular attention to programs administered by the Rockefeller Foundation. Chapters three and four examine the rise, in the 1940s and 1950s, of cybernetics and information theory as an ideal of scientific neutrality and political orderliness. These chapters demonstrate how programs sponsored by the Rockefeller Foundation, MIT, and other institutions shaped linguist Roman Jakobson's and anthropologist Claude L{\'e}vi-Strauss's efforts to redefine their fields as communication sciences. Chapter five considers how critics of cybernetics, including Noam Chomsky, Claude Shannon, and Roland Barthes, critically re-evaluated the claims of cybernetics to redefine the relations between technical research and the human sciences.},

Media are practices that use strategies of spatialization to enable one to manipulate the order of things that progress in time by transforming singular events in reproducible data.

'' One book grows out of another; the trouble is not only is there no end to it, but after the second is pressing upon you before you can finish the first, for planning is more fun than working.'' 78 Indeed, this mode of working was common to all of Mills' projects. He worked fast and furiously and always juggled a number of different ideas in various stages of formation. This certainly was the case with The Cultural Apparatus. In a 1955 letter to his publisher Mills enthusiastically said of the book '' I'm into it.'' He predicted, optimistically, that unlike his other books, this book would be easy, a natural for him that '' writing it will not involve the anguish that White Collar and Elites have provided.'' By 1959, however, Mills had to admit that this optimism was premature. In '' The Personal Note to the Reader'' he confessed that '' I've never had so much trouble writing a book as I have with this one, and I've never taken so much pain with the writing of it as I've taken to heart the criticism of being repetitious, verbose and prone to jargon.'' 79 Mills never completed the project. By the late 1950's he became preoccupied with the political issues of '' war and peace'' and American foreign policy in Cuba, the latter in particular. His health was poor as a result of a heart attack he suffered in December of 1959 on the eve of a televised debate with an American advisor in Latin America, A.A. Berle. He became embroiled in what he understood as necessary public work from within the media and he remained adamant about the personal significance of The Cultural Apparatus in 1959.},

Early work was mainly on television news journalism in the United Kingdom. It focused on issues relating to the economy and industrial relations and developed new methods of content analysis using a videotaped database. As the work developed new topics were explored, including issues of war and peace media coverage, representations of AIDS, child sexual abuse, bovine spongiform encephalitis (BSE: "mad cow disease"), mental health, breast cancer and the communication of risk and the reporting of disasters in Africa. With this extension of topics new methods of research have been used to consider source-journalist relations and reception analysis through the use of focus groups. In this way the attempt has been made to achieve a better understanding of the processes which go to make up the circuit of communication.},

Seldes's journalism is compared with the early twentieth-century muckraking movement associated with national magazines, which positioned journalists as national cultural entities concerned with the common good and able to shape public opinion and political action through their investigations of government and business wrongdoing. An examination of Seldes's critiques and a review of the reception to his work reveal how the corporatization of the press and advances in technology transformed muckraking journalism. Muckrakers continued to use investigative techniques to highlight injustice and justify reform, but Seldes's work demonstrates that those who crusaded too vehemently ran the danger of violating standards of impartiality and objectivity and having their work cast as radical and subversive.},

This piece notes that in the 30 years since Stuart Hall published his seminal essay, ``Notes on Deconstructing the Popular,'' the power relations that define the term as well as the way in which scholars study the popular have shifted in profound ways. The authors argue that, rather than simply equating the popular with popular culture, it is necessary to recognize that the popular is a contingent term that marks the possibility of constituting forms of collective agency and the potential for bringing about social and political change.},

With an eye towards contemporary media problems, this project aims to recuperate lost alternatives and yield fresh insights regarding the institutional role of the press in a modern democratic society. By situating the Hutchins Commission in a historical trajectory of media criticism and media reform movements, this paper illuminates perennial tensions and confrontations between the liberal ideals and commercial imperatives driving the US press system. Drawing from Gramscian theory to contextualize the US media system's current crisis, the paper concludes by outlining an emergent consensus that calls for structural reform and for re-evaluating core normative democratic principles underpinning the social contract between US media institutions and the public.},

Since that time, few studies have made significant theoretical contributions. This apparent slowdown is inconsistent with certain trends in the media industries and in the academy that logically should result in greater production of seminal studies. The question is why so few milestones have been produced in recent years? A possible answer is that certain trends are taking place in U.S. society that tend to reduce the number of ground-breaking studies that will be produced by contemporary academics. Specifically, social scientists have turned from media studies to their more traditional research agenda; increasing attention is being paid to qualitative analysis by today's media scholars, and many are now preoccupied with critical perspectives rather than research.

We then expose the different ways game studies are talking about games through a topic model analysis of our corpus.

Produced by UNESCO's Department of Mass Communication, the picture book represents the organization's early-postwar confidence in the power of scientific knowledge as a social remedy and diplomatic tool. In keeping with a significant component of the race campaign, What Is Race? presented genetics as the route to an enlightened, scientific, non-prejudiced understanding of race. This article seeks to explain the book's management, aesthetics and framing in the context of postwar disciplinary and international politics. Viewing UNESCO's race campaign as a high point for an internationalist ideology of mass education, this article also analyses the visual and literary arguments of What Is Race? and proposes that the enduring image of genetics as technical and neutral knowledge was in part shaped by UNESCO's efforts to communicate scientific authority to an apparently 'popular' audience.},

This comparison, utilized in a variety of ways over time, originated in the canonical Four Theories of the Press (Siebert et al., 1963[1956]). This juxtaposition, more broadly, uses the Cold War 'Other' to define what western journalism is, or should be, by what it is not. Building on the theoretical insights of Fredrik Barth and Edward Said, this article traces the construction of this 'Other' in the study of western journalism. Ultimately, the author argues that the use of this 'Other' in the construction of a coherent, meaningful definition of western journalism, and in the explication and justification of journalistic practice therein, constitutes a problematic guide in thinking about the development of journalism in nations that were historically part of this 'Other'.},

My interest in this article is to assess whether this diagnosis applies to communication and media studies in Latin America. My argument is that the field remains united yet fragmented in the region. Unlike communication scholarship in the United States and some European countries, it is grounded in common theoretical and analytical roots laid down in the 1960s and 1970s. Foundational studies produced made original and important contributions to the field at large, most notably, the study of media/cultural imperialism, innovations in communication/media policies, and the intersection between media and cultural dynamics. Since then, the field has become consolidated and expanded with the proliferation of research and universities and the development of various lines of research. The result is the empirical fragmentation of the field in multiple, parallel lines of research. Although fragmentation has produced rich empirical studies on myriad issues, it has yet to produce path-breaking, ambitious arguments that once were distinctive of the '' Latin American'' tradition of communication and media scholarship. What is needed, I argue, is to adopt an analytical position that places theoretical questions at the center, engages with arguments produced in different settings, and participates in broad debates in the global community of communication and media scholars.

  abstract = {Among students at universities and colleges of higher education, as well as in the written press, one can ascertain a growing interest in media theory. There is a conveyor belt of books about new media, but what seems to be missing is knowledge and understanding of the classical media theories of Ernst Cassirer, Susanne Langer, Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, Claude Shannon, Gregory Bateson, Vil m Flusser, Friedrich Kittler, and many others. In Understanding Media Theory, the ideas of these theoreticians and philosophers are explained and applied in a clear and accessible way\textendash{}not by discussing the writers one by one, but by using real examples and analyzing them on the basis of concepts developed in media theory. Consequently, this volume is accessible to a broad public, though it is primarily intended for students and teachers of media studies. The main thrust of media theory is the analysis of how a society is altered by the technical characteristics of the various media it encompasses. Media theory therefore examines popular culture as well as the arts, journalism as well as philosophy, scientific as well as general insights, mass media as well as individualized media. Media theory claims to offer an explanation for all historic and social phenomena.},

As a whole, these studies draw upon different conceptualizations, employ inconsistent operationalizations, and give short shrift to imintportant macroscopic variables. Such inconsistencies potentially account for substantial prointportions of the variance in spiral of silence effects. This paper examines these three areas in greater detail. First, we review key assumptions and theoretical statements of the spiral of silence. Second, we examine how these conceptual issues translate into operational ones. Finally, we outline areas that have remained largely unexplored over the last 25 years. Specifically, we contend that spiral of silence studies in different cultures have failed to take into account culture-specific variables that may mitigate the imintportance of opinion perceptions as predictors of individual behavior or attitudes. In other words, cross-cultural differences are key factors in predicting speaking-out, the key dependent variable in spiral of silence research. As a result, we call for the return to a more macroscopic focus in spiral of silence research.},

Both before and after World War II, academic training for the profession of journalism versus on-the-job apprenticeship system of ?learning by doing? became a frequent dilemma and controversial topic. Beyond a comparative study of the state of the art in different countries, we attempt to show how the so-called ?American model? in journalism education was viewed from Europe and vice versa. As a result, some conclusions about the accuracy or distortion of those views are reached.

Groundbreaking, because she paved new trajectories in the study of popular communication and applied pioneering qualitative research methods to media studies. Toward the end of the 1970s, when only few perceived that popular culture was a legitimate field of inquiry and even fewer believed that interpretative efforts in the spirit of the humanities were worth institutionalizing in the social sciences, it was Tamar who swam against the stream and completed a pioneering study on the reception of the American soap opera Dallas among members of different cultural communities. Her book The Export of Meaning: Cross-Cultural Readings of Dallas (co-authored with Elihu Katz) soon became canonic and is still being taught in introductory media studies courses around the world. Fearless, because the same road Tamar paved to establish these lines of research and, indeed, to revolutionize the field of communication, was also rife with rivalries, battles, and struggles she never hesitated to engage in.

This seminal work is characterised by an emphasis on liveness and broadcast technology as conditions of eventfulness. The German-language tradition of research on historical media events provides a very different approach to studying media events, starting from the 16th-century advent of mechanical production and distribution. Bringing together these strands of research, the article argues for a deepening of the historical dimension in conceiving of media events. After a critical review of the English-language tradition and an overview of key media-historical research contributions particularly from Germany, it discusses three main themes: the role of temporal acceleration over time by means of media technologies; the role of premeditation in events and the tradition of discussing media-generated events as 'pseudo-events', and the historically shifting relationships between mediated and non-mediated communication in the event. By way of conclusion, the article relates a historical perspective on media events to recent research and discussion around mediatisation.},

Tracing the conceptual origins of agenda building and reviewing relevant scholarship in mass communication, political science, and sociology, the present article seeks to clarify conceptual terminology. As indicators of direction-specific research, the terms policy agenda building, media agenda building, and public agenda building, adapted from Rogers and Dearing (1988), stand to add both clarity and consistency to the scholarly literature. Additionally, with the continued influence of Internet communication, the author suggests that scholarship might be enhanced with consistent use of the term intermedia agenda building, as explained in the article.},

Within this context, however, it is possible to see that most research merely borrows and applies concepts and rudimentary studies developed in other countries, primarily in Great Britain. While this development has its own weight and meaning, the Slovenia's cultural situation is specific enough to oblige cultural studies to develop, at least to some degree, a specific research apparatus that could perceive and thematize the distinctive aspects of Slovene culture. The article addresses this possibility and highlights specifics in the Slovene political, cultural, and historical context that could serve as a point of departure for the development of a distinctively Slovene cultural studies practice.

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to chart the influence of McCarthyism and of FBI surveillance practices on a number of prominent American social scientists, market researchers, opinion pollsters and survey research practitioners during the post-war years. Hitherto disparate sets of historical evidence on how Red Scare tactics influenced social researchers and marketing scientists are brought together and updated with evidence from original archival research. Design/methodology/approach - The paper draws on the existing secondary literature on how social research practitioners and social scientists reacted to the unusually high pressures on academic freedom during the McCarthy era. It supplements this review with evidence obtained from archival research, including declassified FBI files. The focus of this paper is set on prominent individuals, mainly Bernard Berelson, Samuel Stouffer, Hadley Cantril, Robert S. Lynd, Paul F. Lazarsfeld, Herta Herzog, Ernest Dichter, but also the Frankfurt School in exile. Findings - Although some of the historiography presents American social scientists and practitioners in the marketing research sector as victims of McCarthyism and FBI surveillance, it can also be shown that virtually all individuals in focus here also developed strategies of accommodation, compromise and even opportunism to benefit from the climate of suspicion brought about by the prevailing anti-Communism. Social implications - Anyone interested in questions about the morality of marketing, market research and opinion polling as part of the social sciences practicedin vivo will need to pay attention to the way these social-scientific practices became tarnished by the way prominent researchers accommodated and at times even abetted McCarthyism. Originality/value - Against the view of social scientists as harassed academic minority, evidence is presented in this paper which shows American social scientists who researched market-related phenomena, like media, voters choices and consumer behaviour, in a different light. Most importantly, this paper for the first time presents archival evidence on the scale of Paul F. Lazarsfeld's surveillance by the FBI.},

With articles addressing projects such as the Black arts movement in Britain; intellectual versus academic cultural studies in Australia; making meaning of the rise of right-wing populism in Finland; Hall's reception in Latin America and influence on the formation of Latin American cultural studies; a specific media court case in South Africa; addressing the phenomenon of jihadi brides in Britain and reconceptualising continental African blackness, this collection represents Hall as both specific and global intellectual. It also takes us beyond the initial phase of grief to one in which we must go on doing cultural studies, without Stuart Hall's leadership, without guarantees.},

Natural law honors universal law but allows situational responsiveness within this universal.

Toulmin advocated a renewal of the use of casuistry because it is inherently more rhetorical and therefore more applicable than universal ethics, but his theories of argumentation and rhetoric reflect an understanding of the interplay between universal and particular.},

Although posing a potentially radical question- "What makes news?"-these efforts were largely absorbed into and reinforced the limited media effects paradigm of the time. Drawing from interviews with the authors, the authors of this article trace the origin, impact, and intellectual context of these forerunners of media sociology. The authors argue that although these two studies were exceptions to the field's preoccupation with audience and effects, they nevertheless accepted and implicitly reinforced the prevailing media framework built around the commercial publishing and broadcasting industries. As such, they resemble much of the field's research, grounded as it has been in the "limited effects" reinforcement perspective of Lazarsfeld and the broader functionalist tradition of Merton. By calling the news construction process into question, both studies presented potential challenges to the "taken for granted" nature of the media.},

  abstract = {The scientific pollsters (Archibald Crossley, George H. Gallup, and Elmo Roper) emerged onto the American news media scene in 1935. Much of what they did in the following years (1935\textendash{}1948) was to promote both the political and scientific legitimacy of their enterprise. They sought to be recognized as the sole legitimate producers of public opinion. In this essay I examine the, mostly overlooked, rhetorical work deployed by the pollsters to publicize the scientific credentials of their polling activities, and the central role the concept of sampling has had in that pursuit. First, they distanced themselves from the failed straw poll by claiming that their sampling methodology based on quotas was informed by science. Second, although in practice they did not use random sampling, they relied on it rhetorically to derive the symbolic benefits of being associated with the '' laws of probability.''},

Through comparative analyses of Bal{\'a}zs with the racial physiognomist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss as well as with Bal{\'a}zs's fellow Marxist Walter Benjamin, this article outlines key aspects of both right-wing and left-wing physiognomics. While Bal{\'a}zs did share with reactionary physiognomists the problematic idealist tendency to view the body as materialized soul, his views on physiognomy evaded racial essentialism, as he promoted cinematic physiognomics as a way to overcome boundaries of race and nation. Furthermore, Bal{\'a}zs and Benjamin used physiognomic perception to reconfigure social hierarchies and the relationship of spectators to technology and the material world, thus converting potentially reactionary concepts into ones that could be made serviceable for Marxism.},

The notion of the press as the Fourth Estate/Power was a valid concept and legitimate form of the institutionalization of the principle of publicity in the period when newspapers emanated from a new (bourgeois) estate or class: they had a different source of legitimacy than the three classic powers, and developed as a critical impulse against the old ruling estates. Yet the discrimination in favor of the power/control function of the press, which relates to the need of 'distrustful surveillance' defended by Bentham, clearly abstracted freedom of the press from the Kantian quest for the public use of reason. In democratic societies where the people rather than different estates legitimize all the powers, the control dimension of publicity embodied in the corporate freedom of the press should be effectively supplemented by actions toward equalizing private citizens in the public use of reason.},

  volume = {16},
  abstract = {The subject of this article is the emigration of German-speaking communication researchers after 1933 to the US and other countries. The article focuses on Zeitungswissenschaft (newspaper studies) in Weimar Germany and its lost works. Lost, because some of the most brilliant protagonists of this new academic field, which was first established in 1918 at the University of Leipzig, were refugees from Nazi Germany. Often, they were not able to enter an international setting of communication science due to the ruptures in their lives and careers. Their books have not been translated. These theoretical approaches were mainly of sociological impact and far from simple stimulus-response models. The Third Reich, with its aims of propaganda and lack of scientific relevance in the field, marked an end-point to a very innovative process-oriented way of thinking in early communication science in Germany. Most of the protagonists of this new thinking emigrated: for example, the sociologists Karl Mannheim and Ernest Manheim, the communication researchers Walter Auerbach and Gerhard M{\"u}nzner. This article outlines the theoretical background of early communication science in Germany and the context of racist and political persecution and emigration as a social and intellectual breakdown of this science. Actually, this breakdown gains new interest in the German academic community; the past of German communication science and its very dark sides have become topics of discussion and research.},

Over this time period, the desire for consumer products becomes figured by industry observers and researchers as a mode of children's "self expression." The analytic isolation of "the child" in the persona of a "consumer" authorizes a new morality for consumption by construing children's desire for goods as preexistent and thus natural.},

By doing so, it also reminds readers of the necessary relation between theoretical conceptions and historical conditions remarked on by scholars. Such a study also reminds of the contingency of conceptions today, which typically emphasize separately or in combination (a) a kind of content, (b) a means of funding, or (c) the use of new technologies. The article begins by tracing the emergence and development of a dominant interpretive theory based in vanguardism, essentialism, and technological determinism, and concludes by discussing recent efforts that are grounded in materialist theories of culture and society. Such a change signals an ongoing project of generating understandings of alternative media that suggest the reciprocal relationships between modes of production, media forms, and oppositional, participatory practice.},

The data come from four main sources: (1) a survey conducted among Latin American scholars (N = 50), to determine their opinions about the origins, growth, and present state of communication research in the region; (2) a survey conducted among U.S. scholars with experience in Latin America (N = 51), to determine the same information as above but from a point of view that we suspect is somewhat different from that within the region; (3) a citation analysis of the main communication journals to determine the different intellectual influences on Latin American communication scholars; and (4) a content analysis of research published in seven major English language communication journals, and ten major Latin American journals to determine the main topics studied by each group of scholars. Structurally, this dissertation has seven parts. Chapter I introduces the topic and discusses the purpose, central research questions, and research methods. Chapter II deals with the way in which the different research traditions have grown in the region, as well as with the characteristics of the various studies conducted so far on the growth of communication research in Latin America. Chapter III describes the various methods of data collection and data analysis used in the present study. Chapters IV through VI present the major research findings regarding the following issues: (1) stages of development of communication research in Latin America, internal and external factors that determined the emergence of the discipline in the region, its milestones, and major changes over time; (2) major Latin American communication journals and research topics, most influential authors, and countries where research has been conducted; (3) main obstacles to communication research in Latin America, present state of the discipline, and expected changes for the near future. Finally, Chapter VII discusses the results at length, summarizes the main findings, considers some practical and theoretical implications of the study, and suggests further research.},

In response, this article argues that a much needed turn in the paradigm debate should be toward the exploration of the institutionalization of marketing theory. It examines the social, economic and institutional logic underpinning theory production in marketing and demonstrates the influence of McCarthyism and the Cold War climate on marketing theory.},

  abstract = {The major developments of mass communication research, particularly in Britain, during the last fifteen years are reviewed critically. A new revisionist movement has emerged that challenges the dominant radical paradigms of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This has taken the form of contesting the underlying models of society, the characterization of media organizations, the representations of media content, the conception of the audience and the aesthetic judgements that underpinned much `critical' research. The author argues that this revisionism is in part a reversion to certain discredited conventional wisdoms of the past, a revivalism masquerading as new and innovatory thought. However, part of the new critique can be seen as a reformulation that could potentially strengthen the radical tradition of communications research.},

This article investigates the convergence of forces in that propelled this approach to its currently ascendant position. With a nod to Harvey J. Graff's analysis of the mythic power associated with the concept of literacy, the article explores the techniques and rationales that have coalesced around media literacy, making it at once central to the operation of neoliberal capitalism and to its critique. Putting media literacy into a longer history of the instrumental and biopolitical use of media in education and considering the role of education in connecting children's interests to moral and economic regulation, media literacy is taken to be the most recent iteration of a long-standing set of ideas that have been taken up in different ways by early educational reformers, postwar development communications theorists, and countercultural media educators.},

Proponents say this is for the best, arguing that surveys bring the views of citizens closer to civic officials. Critics decry polling's promotion of sycophantic politicians who pander to the whims of public sentiment or conversely, the use of surveys by special interests to thwart the majority will. claims and criticisms were made during the early days of polling. When George Gallup began polling Americans in 1935, he heralded it as a bold step in popular democrat: The views of ordinary citizens could now be heard alongside those of organized interest groups. When brought to Canada in 1941, the Gallup Poll promised similar democratic rejuvenation. In actual practice, traditionally disadvantaged constituencies such as women, the poor, French Canadians in Canada, and African Americans in the United States were often heavily under-represented in Gallup surveys. Preoccupied with election forecasting, Gallup pollsters under-counted social groups thought less likely or unable to vote, leading to a considerable gap between the sampled polity and the general public. Examining the origins and early years of public opinion polling in Canada, Robinson situates polling within the larger context of its forerunners \textendash{} market research surveys and American opinion polling \textendash{} and charts its growth until its first uses by political parties.},

  title = {The {{Making}} of {{Experimental Social Psychologists}}: {{The Creative Legacy}} of {{Kurt Lewin}}},
  abstract = {This study examines the graduate training and research styles of some of Kurt Lewin's intellectual descendents. Specifically the question addressed was: What aspects of the social psychological environment at the Research Center for Group Dynamics while it was at MIT (1945-1948), enabled certain gifted students to develop the skills, enthusiasm and self-permission to be productive later in their careers and in turn, to foster younger scientists to do the same? Those aspect of Lewin's training which may have been responsible for the creative productivity of his intellectual descendents are the focus of this inquiry. These include the influence of Lewin's theory, the experimental method he brought to complex social phenomena as well as his personal style and approach to psychology. Twenty in-depth interviews were carried out and make up an oral history of the graduate training of some of Lewin's descendents. Those interviewed included three faculty members and six social psychologists who were graduate students at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. Also interviewed were eight social psychologists who were trained by members of the original MIT group, two social psychologists who were trained by one of the second generation Lewinians, and one social psychologist with close ties to the group. Some of the aspects of Lewin's training environment which were handed down by his students include: Immediate immersion in research with little emphasis on course work, an interdependent working style in which problem-solving research meetings known as the Quasselstrippe played a key part, task centeredness, intense scrutiny of data, self identification as scientists and use of an apprenticeship method of training. One model of graduate training is to purposefully train students in the art of scientific investigation in order to produce quality researchers. Another model, one followed by some members of the Lewin group, involves selecting the best students and carefully supervising them in order to produce quality research. Beginning with Lewin himself, training students has been a by-product of the pursuit of scientific understanding.},

  volume = {8},
  abstract = {This paper revisits the intellectual development of cultural studies in Latin America in order to assess current challenges and identify lines of research. It is argued that much of the literature has failed to seriously consider key points of cultural studies, namely, the need to be critical about its own epistemological premises and the need to study culture within broad social formations. Since the landmark studies by N{\'e}stor Garc{\'i}a Canclini and Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero laid the foundations in the 1980s, the field of cultural studies has generally aimed to illustrate original arguments instead of using them as a point of departure to analyze media and cultural phenomena. Consequently, many scholars have produced work that while it proves and illustrates original arguments about the hybrid nature of cultures and the complexity of cultural mediation, it does not push the field in new theoretical directions. An additional problem is that, often, the study of culture has been divorced from a close inspection of the linkages between cultural, political, and economic processes, and from the articulations between high and low culture. Consequently, the political underpinnings of the enterprise of cultural studies, as outlined by Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall, have been in the background. This choice has, arguably, restrained the intellectual development and undermined the potential to move theory-building and the debate forward. Additionally, the disinterest in critically exploring theoretical premises has diminished the potential to transcend the boundaries of '' area studies'' in order to engage with the study of media and culture as well as cultural studies globally. The paper concludes by suggesting research directions that might contribute to overcoming the current intellectual impasse.},

Preliminary analysis of the data uncovers the three disciplinary foundations as Library and Information Science, Communication, and Information systems. The Bradford distribution reveals that the core of information society journals is not yet fully established. Journal citation and self-citation patterns lend further support for this and help identify which journals are firmly part of the core and which are less so. Finally, research collaboration patterns demonstrate that this area of research is moving towards disciplinary maturity. The paper concludes with some practical and academic recommendations.},

Nigeria, being a former British colony, at first followed British models of vocational training in journalism. This is evident in the fact that the country's universities did not initially embrace journalism and mass communication studies. Formal university-level training in journalism only started in Nigeria in 1962, with the establishment of Jackson College of Journalism at the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. The college later developed into the Department of Mass Communication. Other departments/schools of journalism or mass communication have sprung up at various Nigerian universities, notably that of the University of Lagos. In the past few years, there has been an upsurge in the number of mass communication programmes across the country. The programmes, apart from journalism, offer courses in broadcasting, public relations and advertising, among other areas. The paper also discusses how contemporary postcolonial Nigerian media education has achieved a large degree of uniformity in all the programmes as a result of initiatives taken by Nigeria's National Universities Commission.},

This article argues that communication-centric analyses fail to engage the politics of information itself, limiting information only to its consequences for communication, and neglecting information as it reaches into our selves, lives, and actions beyond the confines of communication. Furthering recent new media historiography on the ``information theory'' of Shannon and Wiener, the article reveals both the primacy of communication in midcentury information theory, and also a striking resonance between these postwar communication theories and Habermas's more recent communicative theory of democracy. To achieve a critical perspective beyond communication, the article proposes a media genealogy of the politics of subjects as a methodology for developing an analysis of how information formats us as subjects of data.},

This special issue, quite fittingly for this journal, brings together a series of articles, which are written by a set of communication scholars who frequently delve into the messy world that is empirical audience research, but who reflect, here, on the very state and status of the field as it navigates a moment in communication studies scholarship where datafication challenges, perplexes, frustrates, enthuses, and, increasingly, engages in some way or another most communication scholars one meets. In this short editorial, I look at the ways in which these articles approach the field of audience research itself, at a point in time when datafication poses an array of new challenges to mediated societies.},

  abstract = {Audience reception research was a child of the broadcasting age, emerging strongly as a subdiscipline in media and communication research in the 1980s. Many saw reception research as a cross-fertilizing force theoretically and methodologically, bringing together research traditions from the humanities and the social sciences, and adding a qualitative orientation to the near-hegemonic rule of quantitative methods in audience research. This article discusses the ways in which reception research is reinventing itself in a post-broadcasting age. With sense-making processes as the continued key concern, three transformations are affecting the trajectory of reception research: An empirical shift has occurred from analyzing viewers' ``decoding'' encounters with media ``texts'' to mapping audience participation in the wider mediascapes of traditional, digital, and social media; a theoretical adoption of, and contributions to, theories of participation and mediatization; and a methodological shift from purely qualitative to a mixed-method research design.},

I revisit the history of audience research to show how empirical findings contested the pejorative conception of the audience problematically yet persistently imagined by theorists of media power during the twentieth century. As media studies joins other disciplines in responding to the growing datafication of society, I propose that the circuit of culture model can help theorize media (including platform and algorithmic) power by opening up the hermeneutic and action space between production and consumption. In this way, critical scholarship might more effectively analyze such metaprocesses as mediatization and datafication precisely by recognizing rather than erasing audiences' relation to both the everyday lifeworld and the public world of citizen action, regulatory intervention, and the wider society.},

Its central focus is an evaluation of literary adaptations in this pedagogical history; investigating how adaptations of canonical literature were instrumental in the development of film education, and examining how such films were used in the development of teaching materials. Using reports and papers written during the 1930s as its primary evidence, and a comparative analysis of two original study guides on David Copperfield (1935) and A Tale of Two Cities (1935), this article gives a detailed account of how film appreciation was taught in American high schools and exposes the programme's ideological underpinnings. Through an evaluation of such sources the article proposes that whilst using literary adaptations provided a culturally valorized rationale for film education, its reliance on the prestige of literature was ultimately responsible for its failure, since it maintained and promoted the hierarchies between cultural forms.},

  shorttitle = {Homo {{Cinematicus}}},
  abstract = {In the early decades of the twentieth century, two intertwined changes began to shape the direction of German society. The baptism of the German film industry took place amid post-World War I conditions of political and social breakdown, and the cultural vacuum left by collapsing institutions was partially filled by moving images. At the same time, the emerging human sciences\textemdash{}psychiatry, neurology, sexology, eugenics, industrial psychology, and psychoanalysis\textemdash{}began to play an increasingly significant role in setting the terms for the way Germany analyzed itself and the problems it had inherited from its authoritarian past, the modernizing process, and war. Moreover, in advancing their professional and social goals, these sciences became heavily reliant on motion pictures.Situated at the intersection of film studies, the history of science and medicine, and the history of modern Germany, Homo Cinematicus connects the rise of cinema as a social institution to an inquiry into the history of knowledge production in the human sciences. Taking its title from a term coined in 1919 by commentator Wilhelm Stapel to identify a new social type that had been created by the emergence of cinema, Killen's book explores how a new class of experts in these new disciplines converged on the figure of the "homo cinematicus" and made him central to many of that era's major narratives and social policy initiatives.Killen traces film's use by the human sciences as a tool for producing, communicating, and popularizing new kinds of knowledge, as well as the ways that this alliance was challenged by popular films that interrogated the truth claims of both modern science and scientific cinema. In doing so, Homo Cinematicus endeavors to move beyond the divide between scientific and popular film, examining their historical coexistence and coevolution.},

  abstract = {With studies like Discourse Networks 1800/1900 and Gramophone, Film, Typewriter, Friedrich A. Kittler contributed significantly to transforming the history of media into a vital field of inquiry. This essay undertakes to more precisely characterize Kittler's historiographical approach. When we look back on his early contributions to studies of the relationship between literature, madness and truth \textendash{} among others, his doctoral dissertation on the Swiss poet and writer Conrad Ferdinand Meyer \textendash{} what strikes us is the significance that Jacques Lacan's structuralist psychoanalysis had in shaping the orientation of Kittler's later studies. His intensive engagement with Lacan galvanized Kittler's concern with the question of sex and/or gender in the evolution of the humanities as well as his concern with the media history of the university. At the same time, Kittler's reliance on Lacan led him to a kind of history that is interested above all in the internal logic of discourse. As we see, for instance, in Kittler's anecdotic treatment of 19th-century physiologist Hermann von Helmholtz, this historiography does not involve any original research in archives and/or museums. Rather, it builds upon existing historical accounts and focuses its analyses on the issue of symbolic structures. Instead of investigating the history of the material culture of science and technology, what is thereby ultimately reinforced is a philosophical idealism in which knowledge and paranoia become superimposed in and by means of an `original syntax' (Lacan).},

  abstract = {The starting point for any understanding of Jean Baudrillard's media theory is his concept of `communication'. This is heavily indebted to his theory of symbolic exchange, drawn from the Durkheimian tradition running through Durkheim, Mauss, Caillois and Bataille. Common to all these authors is s specific view of human relations, derived from their anthropology, as involving both a communication and a confrontation. Baudrillard, therefore, sees the modern semiotic order as based on the destruction of these symbolic relations, and its media accordingly as founded on a `non-communication'. In symbolic exchange, however, Baudrillard presents a complete and coherent theory of power, and his theory of communication illustrates the possibilities of transformation and reversal of established power and the system of non-communication which the reinstitution of symbolic relations can bring about.},

  abstract = {In the 40 years since McArthur and Resko (1975) published their paper on how men and women are portrayed in TV advertisements, there have been around a hundred replications and extensions in many different countries. There have also been various reviews of this literature (Collins, 2011; Furnham \& Mak, 1999; Furnham \& Paltzer, 2012; Grau \& Zotos, 2016; Matthes, Prieler, \& Adam, 2016). This paper looks specifically at the content-analytic studies done since 2000, and over 50 such studies from many different countries were found. These were examined to understand how the studies have, or have not, moved the literature and research on over the years both methodologically and theoretically. It also examined the nature of the current concerns in this literature. Various consistencies in the portrayal of the central character over all the studies done at different times and in different countries was noted. The central theoretical issue still concerns whether TV mirrors or molds sex roles i},

  volume = {41},
  abstract = {Debates about the role of media and communication in social change are central to our discipline, yet advances in this field are hampered by disciplinary fragmentation, a lack of shared conceptual language and limited understanding of long-term shifts in the field. To address this, we first develop a typology that distinguishes between approaches that foreground the role of media and communication as an agent of change, and approaches that treat media and communication as an environment for change. We then use this typology to identify key trends in the field since 1951, including the sharp downturn in work focusing on economic aspects of change after 1985, the decline of grand narratives of social change since 2000 and the parallel return to media effects. We conclude by outlining the key traits of a processual approach to social change, which has the capacity to offer the basis for shared language in the field. This language can enable us to think of media, communication and social change across its varied temporal and social planes, and link together the processes involved in the reproduction of status quo with fundamental changes to social order.},

  volume = {5},

  abstract = {Ten years ago Davison formulated the third-person effect hypothesis, a novel approach to the study of public opinion. Davison proposed that individuals typically assume that mass communications exert a stronger impact on others than the self, and he derived some interesting ideas from this notion. Over the past decade, a number of studies have tested predictions derived from Davison's formulation. This paper reviews and synthesizes research on the third-person effect. A systematic review of third-person effect studies indicates that there is abundant support for the notion that individuals assume that communications exert a stronger influence on others than on the self. However, the third-person effect does not emerge in all circumstances and for all people. The effect appears to be particularly likely to emerge when the message contains recommendations that are not perceived to be personally beneficial, when individuals perceive that the issue is personally important, and when they perceive that the source harbors a negative bias. Considerably less is known about the processes that underlie the third-person effect. This paper proposes several explanations for the effect, and it suggests some directions for future research in this area.},
