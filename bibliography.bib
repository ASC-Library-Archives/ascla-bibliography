  abstract = {The academic discourse on the West and the East is not new, and it has been commonly believed that non-Western countries must learn from the West in order to develop their own societies. Here, comprehending the notion of the West is considered significant, as it offers a model of comparison. While it is not necessary for the perspectives and process to be radical, it should be convincing to grasp Asia as a formation of a changeable force to the West. Of course, media scholars have to avoid limited perspectives emphasizing only intra-Asian dialogues; instead they must analyze Asian perspectives in the globalization context. What non-Western scholars must contemplate are not only paradigms that are unique to Asian society but also general trends and norms that apply to the globe so that they can identify new trends and directions, which provide fundamentals to advance new theories and norms in global media studies. This certainly contributes to a broadening of media theory and comprehension in a way that takes account of the practices of non-Western countries outside the Anglo-American sphere. },

  abstract = {In this article, I reflect on the theoretical rise of the public sphere in the 1990s from the vantage point of South Korea, connecting this approach to the broader context of the global post–Cold War transition. The case of South Korea – a postcolonial, authoritarian country with deep geopolitical connections to the West – offers a node of the global embrace of the public sphere in the 1990s for theorizing the transformation of authoritarian countries into liberal capitalist democracies, elevating the distinction between state and civil society as a prominent focus. However, the establishment of authoritarian public spheres in Asia and the illiberal turn of public spheres in the Global North in the 2010s call upon scholars to identify relevant questions regarding current public spheres while addressing what essential components define the public sphere. Here, I call for critical attention to the loci of power and oppression, to the production of critical practices within a particular social configuration, and to coexistence within a civil society. I end the article by proposing a set of suggestions for reading, theorizing, and teaching public sphere theories. },

It specifically implies a decentring of the discipline of art history towards the interdisciplinary study of sociocultural visibilities. This paper deals with the development of this research field in an intellectual climate still characterised by the ‘Culture Wars’ engaged in by the neoconservatives against certain areas of the academy and the artistic world during the 1980s. By taking into account the struggles about Visual Studies inside the intellectual Left as an integral part of their definition, this paper analyses the academic politicisations of the notions of ‘Visual Culture’ (culture visuelle) and ‘Visual Studies’ (études visuelles) in the context of the current French importation and redefinition of these categories. },

  abstract = { The late twentieth century visual turn established the study of visual culture as central to the humanities and social sciences. Yet there is no consensus over the scope of the field that has come to be known as visual studies. This article offers a dialectical account in response. It finds a precedent in two dialectical models that have been prominent in visual studies, namely those of Walter Benjamin and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. It argues that the work of Merleau-Ponty offers the better model for a contemporary dialectic because it is not tied to a particular ideological position. Merleau-Ponty’s work can be used to ground a dialectic of visual culture which begins with the eye and has as its three main moments the life-world, representation, and technology. Each of these three moments is explored in turn in order to demonstrate that this is a genuine dialectic in the sense that the final stage returns to the initial position but leaves it thoroughly transformed. The advantage of this approach is that it yields, for the first time, an account of the study of visual culture that does not rely on ideological or methodological principles to explain the range of the field. },

  abstract = {Widespread concerns about new technologies—whether they be novels, radios, or smartphones—are repeatedly found throughout history. Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology’s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies. },

It interrogates how Lewis's initial ambivalence towards an emergent technological society shifted through direct encounters with mechanized warfare, and speculates on the effect of these upon his post-war writing and criticism. By contrasting Lewis's thought against that of his Italian Futurist contemporaries, I will demonstrate the centrality of their divergent conceptions of masculinity in accounting for this opposition – and how Lewis's critique of technological society prefigures contemporary opposition towards the post-humanist philosophy of Accelerationism. },

Subsequent authors have offered their own rationalizations and expanded upon his game categories but have not explained Caillois’s approach. This essay performs a close reading of Man, Play and Games in order to evince his methodology. I argue that Caillois holds to the idea that play reproduces uncertainty in a safe and confined way but that a paradox troubles this vision and pushes him into a baroque formalism. Instead of a simple relation between model and copy, Caillois develops another, stranger concept of mimesis that continues and extends his Surrealist writing about insects and the unconscious. My reading builds on previous analyses of Caillois within game studies, sociology, and media theory to revise the methodological presuppositions built into the categorization of games. },

  abstract = {Our goal in this article is to understand the historical sequences as well as consequences of the internet on the development of the academic field of communication. As a field that has one foot in the study of a most basic and necessary human activity, and another foot in the study of innovative technology, has scholarship in the field of communication followed internet developments? Is there a lag between technological developments and communication research focused on those developments? We attempt to answer our questions by searching for keywords (such as computer, internet, CMC, etc.) in content from communication journals from 1970 to 2000. We find that a large number of keywords were entirely absent, and many of the occurrences involved the same small number of terms, indicative of a relatively narrow and/or shallow amount of interest in these phenomena. The dominance of terms like ‘computer’ and ‘internet’ (and, eventually, ‘Web’) indicate a generalist tone at work in these articles. There is relatively little breadth in the vocabulary related to computers and the internet, suggesting that the field of communication that was seemingly trying to digest the entire (constructed) category of behavior associated with computers and the internet in one gigantic linguistic bite rather than focusing on activities taking place via this new medium. There was not yet a sense of meaningful differentiation in what internet-based communication could involve; ‘internet’ communication was simply communication occurring by means of an internet-based delivery system; a new medium, figuratively and literally. },

Convinced that the report was “part of a plot” to destroy the First Amendment, McCormick underwrote a 642-page rebuttal, Prejudice and the Press: A Restatement of the Principle of Freedom of the Press with Specific Reference to the Hutchins-Luce Commission, by Tribune reporter Frank Hughes. The story behind Prejudice and the Press represents an unknown chapter in the midcentury battle between conservative publishers and liberal press critics. Although Prejudice and the Press is meandering, snide, and suffused with red-baiting, it effectively rebuts a key foundation of A Free and Responsible Press. },

It asks how and to what extent these three political regimes conceptualized propaganda as a knowledge-based practice and what kind of expertise they mobilized. Although American propaganda strategists were the only ones to make use of modern social science methods as part of their activities, under the difficult circumstances of ongoing war operations, the practices of knowledge production by military intelligence did not fundamentally differ between the three countries. The war profoundly changed the way knowledge was systematically mobilized for political and military purposes, and transnational entanglements, perceptions, and observations (but also misperceptions and projections) played a crucial role in that development. This directly connects World War II developments to the emergence of a Cold War regime of producing and using scientific knowledge for strategic purposes. },

  abstract = {For more than a century—dating as far back as 1907, when the first German-language film publications were initially established—Filmkritik (criticism, historiography, all manner of cultural discourse on cinema) has been a prized form of expression, a thriving intellectual, journalistic, and professional enterprise. More limited in scope at the start, it quickly blossomed during the Wilhelmine and Habsburg Empires, through the interwar and postwar periods, and into the twenty-first century. Over the years it has faced numerous challenges: the political rifts of the twentieth century (including the Third Reich and the East-West divide), the technological shifts of the medium and the modes of writing about it (from silent to sound pictures, print to digital), the exigencies of archival initiatives and film preservation. At the same time, from its beginnings Filmkritik has been a relentlessly international affair, traversing national borders and transcending the limits of language and origin. Moreover, Filmkritik has persistently crossed the Atlantic due not only to the migration of prominent critics and filmmakers themselves but to the receptive audiences and readerships on both sides.},

This development, however, has not been without its detractors. Specifically, Michael Haneke’s Caché (2005) can be interpreted as an ambivalent statement about the power of the critic.},

The symptomatic impetus that had figured so strongly during the postwar era gave way to the so-called new subjectivism of young critics like Michael Althen, Claudius Seidl, and Andreas Kilb. They looked askance at the formal complexity and political activism of most art house fare and above all found themselves smitten by mainstream American features. Taking their cue from Susan Sontag and her essay “Against Interpretation,” these postmodern existentialists cultivated a highly personalized, indeed rarefied form of poetic empiricism. This study analyzes their sensibility and rhetoric, their emphases and oversights. It focuses on Dominik Graf’s essay film, Was heißt hier Ende? (Then Is It the End?, 2015), a tribute to Althen and the cohort of young critics with whom he worked and interacted.},

Leaving aside reviews that have already been translated elsewhere, and focusing almost exclusively on the silent period, the present selection was guided by two considerations. First, it includes reviews of several films that have entered the canon of world cinema (The Last Laugh, The Blue Angel, The Man with the Movie Camera, Girls in Uniform). Second, it reflects Kracauer’s attraction, particularly during the early 1920s, to American slapstick.},

Our findings describe comparative studies of Internet use as an increasingly diverse topic in terms of its widespread publication outlets across different (sub)fields in communication studies, along with emerging dimensions of comparison. Meanwhile, conventional pitfalls and limits remain, including the easily ignored consideration and justification of equivalence and comparability in the research object and the analytical method, as well as the remaining dominant cross-territorial perspective and quantitative methods. We offer corresponding proposals to overcome pitfalls and advance future comparative studies of Internet use and, in a broader sense, comparative communication research.},

The history of the book helps revise the earlier relative marginalisation of cultural vis-à-vis political history. The publication in 1958 of L’apparition du livre by Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin has been followed by a series of multivolume, multi-authored national histories of the book and libraries, first in France, then in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. The history of book is having considerable influence in many areas of historical investigation, such as general history, literary history, the history of science and the history of religion. With the ‘Digital Revolution’, the history of the book is now converging with studies of the other media and, together with the growth of postcolonial/post-imperial studies in general, offers the prospect of a balanced and nuanced approach within the global academy to understanding the world’s media past, present and future. },

The roots of the schism between the economic and the cultural lie in the growing influence of French structuralism, and post-structuralism from the late 1960s onwards. Jim McGuigan’s book, Cultural Populism, appeared at a time when socialist politics, political analysis and cultural theory were, both together and separately, in a degree of flux, self-reflection and loss of direction. This article outlines the nature of the split between emphasis on the cultural and the economic, the ways in which it continues to mark the field and the importance of continuing to try and hold the two together in the analytic frame. Methodologically, this article involves analysis of Cultural Populism and utilises document and archive searching, interviews, syllabus analysis and personal communication. },

I deepen this argument by outlining the history of ‘popular education’ in Europe and beyond in the modern period to illustrate how the coming together of subaltern political movements and intellectual inquiry created an independent public sphere of radical self-enlightenment. In this article, by utilising archival and textual sources, I should like to explore whether it may be possible to renew the original project of Cultural Studies through radical programmes of ‘popular’ adult education in the digital age. I see Jim McGuigan’s work as offering ‘resources of hope’, in Raymond Williams’ phrase, for this tradition in the universe of academic Cultural Studies. },

There is, however, an arena of British cultural studies that has always been concerned with ‘sentiment’ and that is the romance narrative. This article argues that the study of popular fictions has always been integral to the history of cultural studies, and that it established a site in which feminist voices would make gender politics intrinsic to the field. At a time when gender was not a central issue for either Literature or Cultural Studies, generic fictions written by and for women provided a site for research that was undeniably about female experience, and the analysis of those texts offered a strategy for asserting a feminist focus. },

  abstract = {This article unpacks the concept of ‘cultural populism’ in multiple ways, and explores its value for the critical analysis of new formations and expressions of populism in the current conjuncture. Taking Jim McGuigan’s influential book, Cultural Populism, as our point of departure, we begin by exploring its earlier use in cultural studies as a critical term for apolitical/celebratory modes of analysis, and then argue it may be usefully extended today to refer to popular and political efforts to construct a ‘people’ in overtly cultural terms. Second, we make the case for renewing an expressly ‘critical populist’ stance, one that is attentive to ordinary tastes and pleasures, while also locating and analysing them in relation to the production of needs and desires within a capitalist political economy, and that is attuned to the political possibilities for change. Third, we argue that the resources of cultural studies should be mobilised to redress some of the deficiencies of dominant accounts of populism from political science, and suggest that the twin concepts of cultural and critical populism offer an advance over the elitist and culturally reductive mode of analysis associated with Inglehart and Norris’ conception of ‘cultural backlash’. We conclude by offering an overview of the other contributions to the special issue, as they seek to push the concept of cultural populism in new directions, while also critically engaging with residual, dominant and emergent popular and populist currents in these new populist times. },

  abstract = {As Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney for over 20 years (1978–2001), György Márkus exerted a profound influence on a generation of philosophers and students from many disciplinary backgrounds. His legendary lecture courses, spanning the history of modern philosophy from the Enlightenment through to the late 20th century, were memorable for their breadth, erudition, and philosophical drama. Always modest despite his mastery of the tradition, Márkus’s approach to this history of philosophy never failed to emphasize its continuing role in shaping our inherited understanding of philosophy as ‘its own time comprehended in thoughts’ (Hegel). This is especially true of his contribution to the philosophical discourse of modernity, which we could summarize as comprising an original philosophy of cultural modernity. In what follows, I briefly reconstruct Márkus’s account of the adventures of the concept of culture, focusing on his definitive essay ‘The Path of Culture: From the Refined to the High, From the Popular to Mass Culture’ (2013) but also referring to other relevant Márkus texts, offering some critical remarks on his account of culture and its relationship with modern aesthetics, both classical and contemporary. },

AS PART OF THIS RETROSPECTIVE, WE ALSO REPRINT THE ORIGINAL 1971 ARTICLE “DEVELOPMENT COMMUNICATION IN THE AGRICULTURAL CONTEXT” BY NORA QUEBRAL, WITH A NEW FOREWORD BY HER.  How did the discipline and practice of development communication begin? Who were the founders and how were the first experiments implemented? Rejecting the ideologically populist views that locates development communication origins within western development scholarship, the following postcolonist exposé appraises various communication uses in development that emerged from different parts of the world in the past 50 years. The discussion holds that the pioneering development communication experiments were located between postcolonial and underdevelopment theories, and as such, to understand its origins, a study must focus on the earliest non-commissioned and community-originated experiments, as this study purports to do. },

  abstract = {This article outlines the emergence of Husserl’s theory of ‘communication proper’ (Mitteilung or Kommunikation) in the context of his genetic analyses of intersubjectivity. It defines the meaning and function of Mitteilung in contradistinction with the notion of empathy and thus demonstrates its distinct generative constitution. I propose that Mitteilung has the capacity to cancel the ‘operative’ opposition between social acts and instinctive intersubjectivity and thus to frame a non-determinist theory of sociality. This capacity is largely ignored by the dominant interpretation, according to which the concept of communication in Husserl is derivative of the more fundamental category of empathy. A major consequence to this argument is that it determines why eminent readers of Husserl such as Derrida have missed an important opportunity when they failed to notice the distinct role of Mitteilung. This alternative view is expanded onto communication media in general by taking Kittler’s project as a vantage point. },

  abstract = {This article reanimates the Adorno–Benjamin debate to investigate the potential of contemporary technologised consumer culture to become a space for bottom-up political agency and resistance. For both Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, the technological advancement of the 20th century had an inherently irrational character, as evidenced by the self-destructive tendencies of humanity during the Second World War. Nonetheless, the thinkers famously disagreed when it came to the implications of the marriage between technology and mass culture. Discerning its potential for the mobilisation of the masses, Benjamin believed that technology would politicise mass culture, allowing society to employ it for its political ends – an idea which Adorno debunked. Technologised consumer culture has noticeably evolved since the time of the debate. Nevertheless, revisiting the debate is necessary to understand a contradiction between the expanded possibilities for political participation and the return of the ‘auratic’ or cultic function of technologised consumer culture. At the same time, the article shows that technology does politicise consumer culture. However, the pitfall lies in that the politicisation is done through technology as a tool, which is vulnerable to appropriation, granting those who are in the position to control it a substantial political resource. Consequently, the article argues that the politicisation of consumer culture risks having a reverse effect of facilitating the aestheticising of politics – turning politics into a spectacle. },

  abstract = {Concerns about selective exposure and disinformation in the digital news environment have brought the concept of news diversity to the forefront of academic debates. Despite its growing prominence in scholarly work, however, news diversity often remains hard to grasp. The current paper aims to re-assess what the concept of news diversity means in an evolving news ecology. To do so, we draw on three dominant conceptualizations of news and media diversity. We use their strengths to unravel the variety in conceptualizations of news diversity and to explain how diversity is built on different conceptual and normative assumptions towards news media and democracy. Based on these insights, we perform a systematic literature review in which we map the current communication science literature that address news diversity. Results show that 43 different news diversity dimensions have been used in literature, indicating a form of academic cherry-picking with both normative and conceptual implications. We propose a way forward by formulating recommendations for future diversity research. This includes a shift to a more theoretically grounded approach in conceptualizing news diversity, a call for interdisciplinary research, and giving the idea of normativity a more pronounced place in research on news diversity. },

The author is critical of diffusion research in Latin America because of its too-close copying of the "made-in-the-USA" classical diffusion model. The theoretical approach of Paulo Freire's "conscientization" is recommended as one corrective influence on the diffusion model in Latin America and elsewhere. },

  abstract = {Since its inception, the internet has been as much technological as social, practical as ideological in character. This article examines academic discourse and asks how research on the multifaceted internet has evolved over the past 25 years. In order to investigate the formation of this academic field, we collected articles published in major academic journals dedicated to new media and digital communication as well as mainstream periodicals in communication studies over the past quarter of a century. Relying on a combination of (semi)automated content analysis and citation analysis, we find that articles related to the internet and its manifold aspects are cited more often than research on other topics. The literature review suggests that as the socio-material infrastructure of the internet has become deeply enmeshed in society its study has evolved from a niche pursuit to the discipline’s core area of inquiry. },

Most of the 300 Africans who graduated the African Training Scheme’s six-month-long course already were working at newspapers, radio stations and government ministries—often where British expatriates were leaving. The exposure to Western professional practices boosted many of their careers. The IPI’s Nairobi school operated from 1963 to 1968 and was ‘probably the most effective’ of the more than a half dozen crash courses that sought, largely successfully, to put a Western stamp on African journalism education. Finally, both Ford and the IPI prized the network of journalists and officials they had forged almost as much as the education they had provided. },

  abstract = {This essay presents a detailed analysis of Georg Simon Ohm’s acoustical research between 1839 and 1844. Because of its importance in Hermann von Helmholtz’s subsequent study of sound and hearing, this work is rarely considered on its own terms. A thorough assessment of Ohm’s articles, however, can greatly enrich our understanding of later developments. Based on study of Ohm’s published writings, as well as a lengthy unpublished manuscript, the essay argues that his acoustical research foreshadows an important paradigmatic shift at a time of discursive instability prior to Helmholtz’s influential contributions. Using Ohm’s own dismissal of his supposedly “unmusical ears” as a conceptual frame, the essay describes this shift as a move away from understanding sound primarily in a musical context and toward an increasingly mathematical approach to sound and hearing. As such, Ohm’s work also anticipates a more general change in the role of the senses in nineteenth-century scientific research. },

To build this as an original argument we firstly outline Freire’s ontological call, presenting and discussing his underlying five principles, of which one in particular, dialogue, situates Freirean thinking within communication theory. Secondly, we trace Freire’s legacy by presenting and discussing how Freire inspired three significant Ibero-American thinkers and practitioners within performing arts (Augusto Boal), communication (Juan Diaz Bordenave) and epistemology of change (Boaventura de Sousa Santos). This analysis underscores Freire’s significant legacy along global intellectual pathways both within humanities and social sciences. Finally, we deepen our analysis of Freire’s vision of development and social change, unpacking how he navigates between a normative vision grounded in a utopian aspiration for change, and a very systematic and rigorous methodology, his liberating pedagogy. },

  abstract = {Journalism scholars have acknowledged the importance of innovation in journalism. A common finding is that journalism has difficulty adapting to change and uses multiple coping mechanisms, including making excuses for not innovating by relying on their professional norms and practices. However, such research does not more broadly show how journalism studies research has shaped what scholars have learned about innovation practices. The goal of this study is to provide a systematic literature review of news innovation research since the 1990s. This article deploys a qualitative content analysis of peer-reviewed journal articles about news innovation in media and journalism studies. It shows that journalism and media scholars discuss news innovation as normative, participative, and experimentative. Journalism studies scholarship has also focused on innovation as a process, integrating elements of audience engagement, structure, system, and network. The goal of this study is twofold. First, it discusses the methodological and conceptual/theoretical approaches taken in scholarly journal articles about news innovation. Second, it outlines limitations of such approaches and draws conclusions to conceptualize knowledge in this subfield of research. It argues that it is important to take into account those limitations, as they pose problems for the cumulative nature of news innovation research knowledge. },

This article starts with a brief overview of the research conducted in translation studies. The next two sections discuss the conceptualization of “translation” in the two disciplines and highlight the historical importance of translation in news production respectively. The topic of “conflict” is discussed in the next section as an example of the importance of translation in news production and dissemination.

  abstract = {This article examines the collaborations between Marshall McLuhan, the architectural historian Sigfried Giedion, and the modernist town planner Jaqueline Tyrwhitt in the 1950s. Giedion’s studies of everyday material culture and his concern with the human scale of cities became central to McLuhan’s proposal for studying media. Through a historical analysis of Tyrwhitt’s papers and correspondence, the paper documents her role in mediating a dialogue between McLuhan and Giedion and in co-founding, with McLuhan and others, the Explorations Group at the University of Toronto. Drawing upon Giedion’s concern with the humanization of urban life, Tyrwhitt helped formulate a methodology that used the urban environment and architecture as the framework to analyze the effects of media. The paper argues that Tyrwhitt’s own contributions to the Explorations journal took up both Giedion and McLuhan’s focus on media and material culture and their commitment to interdisciplinarity in examining the mediated experience of urban life.Résumé : Cet article examine les collaborations pendant les années 50 entre Marshall McLuhan, l’historien de l’architecture Sigfried Giedion et l’urbaniste moderniste Jaqueline Tyrwhitt. Les études de la culture matérielle de tous les jours effectuées par Giedion et son souci d’assurer une dimension humaine aux villes sont devenus des éléments centraux dans l’approche aux médias proposée par McLuhan. Cet article, au moyen d’une analyse historique des archives et de la correspondance de Tyrwhitt, recense le rôle que celle-ci a joué pour encourager un dialogue entre McLuhan et Giedion et pour établir, avec McLuhan et d’autres, le groupe Explorations à l’Université de Toronto. Tyrwhitt, s’inspirant de la volonté de Giedion d’humaniser la vie urbaine, a contribué à l’élaboration d’une méthodologie qui se rapporte à l’environnement urbain et à l’architecture pour analyser les effets des médias. Cet article soutient que les contributions de Tyrwhitt à la revue Explorations ont tenu compte à la fois de l’accent mis par engagement interdisciplinaire afin d’étudier les expériences médiatisées de la vie urbaine.},

  abstract = {This article attempts to uncover the intellectual, economic, and methodological structures that have led to the recent emergence of a particular notion of digital communication on social media platforms, one that emphasizes the power of (false) media messages to cause irrational political behavior and combines individual level understanding of media effects with a networked notion of society and information diffusion. After pointing out some of the real political-economic forces at work in setting the contours of this intellectual turn, I discuss how spaces between mutually constructed but overlapping paradigmatic understandings of media behavior lead to theories that serve as boundary objects, linking (and misunderstanding) older fields in order to advance new agendas. I then turn to the consequences of particular methodological choices, drawing on key works in Science and Technology Studies (STS) to make the point that these methodological choices not only establish scientific fields, they construct certain types of human subjects as well. The article concludes with a call for a more humanistic and interpretive approach to the understanding of political behavior and communication.},

These interrelated features articulate the central dimensions of journalism studies, establishing the boundaries of the field and its relational, cultural, holistic, ecological, and contextual acts of scholarship.

Therefore, it examines both the habitus and the capital of the 26 communication researchers from outside the United States who have been distinguished as ICA presidents and fellows. The study contributes to the discipline’s reflexivity and shows that despite the expansion of ICA’s leadership, the field’s power pole is still a U.S.-centered enterprise. Today, ICA’s international leadership is located in world regions closely linked to the United States and educated at U.S. universities or heavily influenced by North American research traditions, even if it includes a numerous contributions from other associations and alternative approaches. Consequently, this internationalization hardly changed ICA but instead changed the world’s communication field. At least up to a certain extent, new perspectives are perceived at the discipline’s power pole. However, in return, national academic environments in U.S.-affiliated countries became Americanized, especially via ICA fellows serving as role models to get scientific capital. Thus, ICA’s efforts to expand its leadership are assumed to have an unintended effect of conserving the power structures in the field.},

  abstract = {This article develops the concept of «operational media» to think through the deployment of utility/useful cinema in the context of cybernetically informed educational policy. The paper argues that cybernetic concepts of communication, feedback loops and homeostasis were central to the pragmatic installation of media at the center of postwar mass education. Links are made to the dominance of cybernetic ideas in postwar social science, including social psychology, sociobiology and behaviourism. A consideration of the UN’s operational media allows for a reconsideration of the agency’s communicative mandate as biopolitical and governmental. Educational policies influenced by the UN were doubly concerned with technologized classrooms: cybernetic ideas presented themselves as politically neutral, while offering efficiencies in the delivery of content. Cold war citizenship was thus conceived as a form of training that would pragmatically lead to the rebalancing of a volatile international situation. Carrefour de la vie (1949), made by Belgian filmmaker Henri Storck for the United Nations, is presented as an example of the centrality of mental health for citizenship training in postwar biopolitical regimes. In particular, the tension between the film’s humanist and cybernetic strands are considered. Au Carrefour de la vie is considered as a transitional text, presenting a humanist story of childhood in postwar life that simultaneously prefigures the operation of a controlled society.},

As soon as the Board's staff began work on improving US psychological operations, they wondered how social science might help them achieve their task. Board Director, Gordon Gray, asked physicist turned research administrator Henry Loomis to do a full review of America's social science research program in support of psychological operations. Loomis willingly accepted the task. This paper documents Loomis's investigation into America's social science research program. It uncovers the critical role that government departments had in the creation of research in the early 1950s and thus highlights that the government official is an important actor in the history of social science and the application of social science to psychological operations at the beginning of the Cold War.},

  abstract = {The rise of social media has recently inspired a renewed debate about the decentering of the subject. Some scholars have responded to Facebook’s seemingly intrusive influence over people’s emotions by reviving humanistic notions of the autonomous subject, while others have continued to insist on the subject’s constructedness. This article provides a historical perspective on this issue by revisiting another moment that, in some ways, parallels contemporary anxieties about social media. In the mid-18th century, critics worried that the increasing popularity of reading was producing unruly emotions and extreme opinions. These concerns inspired a number of attempts to reassert the primacy of spoken language, including programs of elocution instruction that trained people in reading out loud. Focusing on James Burgh’s 1761 book The Art of Speaking, this article argues that the elocution movement employed a different conception of selfhood from the modern notion of subjectivity: rather than treating the subject as the ultimate source of emotion, the elocutionists judged emotional reactions to texts based on a normative notion of the general good. I argue that this ethically grounded view of the self could provide a useful framework for understanding the stakes of the present anxiety about the emotional effects of media. },

  abstract = { AbstractScholars in both digital humanities and media studies have noted an apparent disconnect between computation and the interpretive methods of the humanities. Alan Liu has argued that literary scholars employing digital methods encounter a “meaning problem” due to the difficulty of reconciling algorithmic methods with interpretive ones. Conversely, the media scholar Friedrich Kittler has questioned the adequacy of hermeneutics as a means of studying computers. This paper argues that that this disconnect results from a set of contingent decisions made in both humanistic and mathematical disciplines in the first half of the nineteenth century that delineated, with implications that continue to resonate in the present day, which aspects of human activity would come to be formalized in algorithms and which would not. I begin with a discussion of Nicolas de Condorcet, who attempted, at the height of the 1789 revolution, to turn algebra into a universal language; his work, I argue, exemplifies the form of algorithmic thinking that existed before the Romantic turn. Next, I discuss William Wordsworth’s arguments about the relationship of poetry and science. While Wordsworth is sometimes viewed as a critic of science, I argue that his polemic is specifically targeted at highly politicized projects like Condorcet’s that sought to supplant existing modes of thought with scientific rationality. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of Romantic thought for George Boole, creator of the logic system that would eventually form the basis of digital electronics. The reason Boole was able to succeed where Condorcet had failed, I argue, was that Romantic notions of culture enabled him to reconcile a mechanical view of mathematical reasoning with an organic view of the development of meaning—a dichotomy that remains a key assumption of computer interfaces in the twenty-first century. },

Scholars of African American literary and cultural studies were coming to redefine their field around the terms orality and literacy at around the same time that Ong published his book; but where Ong stressed historical change or the fall from orality to literacy, African Americanists tended to accent their mutual mediation. This article explores the way that African Americanists, in stressing mediation, return orality and literacy to the concerns of Ong’s ostensible field: media studies.},

These models have introduced a second dimension of entertainment that incorporates more complex nonhedonic experiences, such as the search for meaning or intrinsic need satisfaction. They have not only crucially altered the way communication scholars conceptualize the audience of media entertainment but also our discipline's view on the effects of entertaining media content. The present article discusses the implications of this changing model of the media user both for entertainment theory and research as well as for the discipline of communication as a whole.}},

  abstract = {{The study of media audiences has long been hotly contested regarding their supposed power to construct shared meanings, to mitigate or moderate media influences, or to complete or resist the circuit of culture. Transformations in the media environment add further grounds for contestation over audience activity or passivity, soâ€“called, given the increasing mediation and digitalization of all dimensions of modern societies. Yet despite such persistent contestation, audiences are often taken for granted within communication theory as, implicitly, an invisible and indivisible mass. The article notes that the audience projectâ€”and thus a grounded recognition of significance of ordinary people's collective and individual experiences of living in a digital ageâ€”seemingly must be reasserted for each generation of scholarship, rearticulating their role in relation to each new phase of sociotechnological change and, perhaps most interesting, reflexively rethinking â€œaudiencingâ€ as the very conditions of modernity are globally reconfigured. After reflecting on the possibility that Western audience researchers have come to take for granted the wider context of audiences' lives, the article observes that one benefit of globalization is a renewed necessity for researchers to articulate that which is taken for granted and thus seek ways to reinsert audiences into the wider analysis of the circuit of culture.}},

We argue that, despite the importance of these early studies, they are not considered in the official history of communication because they failed to leave institutional traces in Latin America and also due to the fact that transnational archival work has only seldom been considered an important source in Latin American history of communication. },

When the Commission began its work in 1943, though, it focused on an additional culprit. Pressure groups, according to the Commission, were propagandizing, issuing threats, and distorting media coverage. Pressure groups fell off the Commission’s agenda, in part because members and staff were unable to agree on whether the groups were democratic or antidemocratic forces. The Commission missed an opportunity to help shape subsequent debates over the anticommunist blacklists and other forms of nongovernmental media censorship. },

Research topics, theoretical frameworks, methodology, and authorship information were analyzed using 223 articles. Results indicate that internal communication research in public relations scholarships has exponentially increased since 2011. Research topics on internal communication have diversified since 2000, from descriptive studies illustrating internal communication practices to a variety of relevant phenomena on employee and organizational outcomes. Public relations theories, such as organization–public relationship and symmetrical communication, have been frequently applied in internal communication research. In terms of methodology and sample, quantitative and qualitative methods have been equally utilized, and employees from multiple organizations were frequently used as a type of sample in a large portion of research works. The most productive researchers and institutions of internal communication research in public relations were also identified. Implications for ongoing internal communication research in public relations disciplines are discussed. To address the limitations of the current study, future studies should incorporate an interdisciplinary and a global perspective.},

Yet, there has been relatively little systematic examination of the growth of comparative journalism studies or in-depth analysis of the power relations within the field in relation to, for example, trends in authorship or dominant methodologies and paradigms. This article reports the results of a systematic review of comparative studies of journalism published between 2000 and 2015, a key growth period for the field. By examining in detail a population of 441 articles published in 22 key journals, we demonstrate that comparative journalism studies is a dynamic field that has developed considerable structure over time, and outline some key patterns, such as a continuing focus on Western authorship, the study of Western countries and elite media, quantitative methods of analysis and political aspects of journalism. },

In the process, it illuminates three structuring patterns: (1) the valorization of European civilization that accompanied U.S. settler colonialism and its manifestation in universities where rhetorical theory materially grounded itself; (2) the gendered production of knowledge within academic institutions, particularly through the masculinization of the postwar university and its shaping of communities of inquiry invested in rhetorical theory; and (3) the power of relevance as a metonym for intellectual, political, and educational initiatives that, beginning in the late 1960s, enlarged rhetorical theory's community of inquiry and range of meanings.},

  abstract = { How to ethically conduct online platform-based research remains an unsettled issue and the source of continued controversy. The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user’s mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user’s relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making. },

What are the differences between them? Are they three different research fields, or three national declinations of the same research program, or what else? Common to all of them nowadays is a more or less immediate reference to the British Cultural Studies, whose circulation however has been different across the three national cases, Italy, France, and Germany (together with Austria). Making use of an array of different sources and methods, this chapter tries to identify the commonalities among these reception histories (also in terms of epistemological foundations) without forgetting their peculiarities with respect to their social and political traditions. In all the three national/regional cases we will examine how the disciplinary and epistemological boundaries have been negotiated among different disciplines and (scholarly, political, and ideological) commitments in order to build new objects of research and a different sensitivity to matters of culture.},

It then examines the activist dimension of Stiegler's later writing projects in the context of his work at the Pompidou Centre's Institut de Recherche et d'Innovation of which he is the founding director, and with Ars Industrialis, the association he co-founded to promote a renewed public sphere engagement with key questions of contemporary technocultural becoming.

  abstract = {Research activities related to social informatics (SI) are expanding, even as community fragmentation, topical dispersion, and methodological diversity continue to increase. Specifically, the different understandings of SI in regional communities have strong impacts, and each has a different history, methodological grounding, and often a different thematic focus. The aim of this article is to connect three selected perspectives on SI—intellectual (regional schools of thought), methodological, and thematic—and introduce a comparative framework for understanding SI that includes all known approaches. Thus, the article draws from a thematic and methodological grounding of research across schools of thought, along with definitions that rely on the extension and intension of the notion of SI. The article is built on a paralogy of views and pluralism typical of postmodern science. Because SI is forced to continually reform its research focus, due to the rapid development of information and communication technology, social changes and ideologies that surround computerization and informatization, the presented perspective maintains a high degree of flexibility, without the need to constantly redefine the boundaries, as is typical in modern science. This approach may support further developments in promoting and understanding SI worldwide.},

  abstract = {Academic interest in what has been termed “infotainment” has grown considerably since the term was coined in the 1980s. Today, the burgeoning field of infotainment research has become an important interdisciplinary field of study producing numerous political, cultural, and social insights. Nevertheless, infotainment remains highly contested, multifaceted, and incoherent, both as a term and a field of study. Preliminary attempts have been made to give greater conceptual clarity and standardization to the term, although their success has been limited, leaving difficulties in analyzing and comparing findings in a unified manner. In this review essay I outline the findings from a comprehensive literature review by delineating three mains trajectories of infotainment research: (1) research on soft news programming; (2) research on traditional news media; and (3) research on media systems and global infotainment. To conclude, I offer three suggestions for future infotainment research, arguing that scholars should attempt to achieve standardization and conceptual clarity within, rather than across research trajectories, that political theory should be more explicitly incorporated into the literature for the purposes of standardizing methods and clarifying normative debates, and that research should also focus on the synergies between contemporary trends in political campaign/communications strategies and trends in infotainment. },

The article presents the Frankfurt School as part of the 1940s’ memorandum culture and thereby attempts to situate the historiography of critical theory during this formative period within a broader intellectual landscape, that is, in dialogue and competition with several other projects, to analyze the Nazi German enemy, in this case, the Culture and Personality School. The article takes Kracauer’s and Bateson’s analyses of the Nazi movie Hitlerjunge Quex as a case in point and, with the help of institutional and biographical contextualization, develops some of their most important methodical innovations and insights into Nazi German propaganda.

Emerging out of a complex mix of political, philosophical, and academic trends, critical rhetoric produced significant shifts in the ways in which criticism was understood and practiced. The shifting and transformations did not, however, stop with the term’s introduction in 1989. In this essay, we trace the development of critical rhetoric through three additional phases: the Marxist challenge presented by Dana Cloud; the shift to vernacular discourse in the works of Kent Ono and John Sloop; and the recent development of participatory critical rhetoric in the works of Michael Middleton et al. We pursue this historical tracing to demonstrate the points of rupture and discontinuity by which critical rhetoric has been transformed.},

  abstract = {Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to revisit Russell Belk’s (1988) landmark paper “Possessions and the extended self”. The authors provide a prehistory of related ideas and then examine the controversy it triggered regarding the different paradigms of research in marketing (Cohen, 1989) some 26 years ago. Design/methodology/approach– This paper takes Belk seriously when he argues that his work is a synthesis and extension of prior studies leading to the novel production of the “extended self” concept. Via a close reading of the history of self-constitution, the authors highlight a number of thinkers who were grappling with similar issues now associated in our disciplinary consciousness to the idea of the “extended self”. To assess the contribution of Belk’s work, the authors engage in citation and interpretive analyses. The first analysis compared scholarly citations of Belk (1988) with the top ten most-cited Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) papers published in the same year. The second citation analysis compared Belk (1988) to the top ten most-cited JCR papers in the history of the journal. The authors follow this with an interpretive analysis of Belk’s contribution to consumer research via his 1988 paper. Findings– Belk (1988) had the most citations (N = 934) of any paper published in JCR in 1988. When compared to all papers published in the history of JCR, Belk (1988) leads with the most overall citations. Moreover, Belk (1988) is the most prominent interpretive paper that appeared in JCR and one of the top three, regardless of paradigm. The analysis illustrates diversity in topic and methodology, thus indicating that Belk’s contribution impacted a wide variety of scholars. Interpretive analysis indicates the importance of Belk’s work for subsequently impactful consumer researchers. Originality/value– The authors offer a prehistory of the “extended self” concept by highlighting literature that many consumer researchers will not have explored previously. With citations spanning over three decades, consumer behavior scholars recognize Belk (1988) as an important paper. Our analysis reveals that contrary to received wisdom, it is not only important for interpretive researchers or scholars within the consumer culture theory, but it is significant for the entire discipline, irrespective of paradigmatic orientation. The research presented here demonstrates that Belk’s (1988) paper is arguably one of the most influential papers ever published in JCR.},

  abstract = {A closer examination of Adorno’s exile in the US, and particularly in Los Angeles in the 1940s, defies the popular view of him as a cantankerous anti-American Eurocentric snob. Rather, his writings and personal letters show how Adorno saw his time in California, the hothouse of the West’s most advanced culture industry, as an opportunity to scrutinize the modern condition. For Adorno, however, this did not have to be a bleak business. Instead, rigorous critique the way Adorno understood it did not mean to put the joys of life on hold and sideline the project of liberation but, on the contrary, to advance it by asserting its emancipatory promise that only pleasure can sustain. },

  abstract = {In his book City of Quartz from 1990, the urban theorist Mike Davis criticized Bertolt Brecht for having failed to explore the “real-life Mahagonny” and “thriving local labor movement” of Los Angeles while he lived there from 1941 to 1947. For someone who considered himself a dialectical thinker, Brecht showed surprisingly little interest in the specific historical dialectic that had shaped Los Angeles. Shortly after moving there, he had already accepted the myth of the “City of Angels” as a hellish materialization of advanced capitalism. The purpose of this essay, which mostly draws upon Brecht’s journal entries, is not to refute Davis’s assessment but to take a closer look at Brecht’s preconceptions and perceptions of American culture and politics to better grasp why he largely ignored, or refused to engage with, the politically progressive developments and working-class movement in a place where he spent six years of his life. },

  abstract = {Two claims are at stake for a science of communication. This essay brings into focus the philosophical distinctions between the human science of communication and the social science of communication. Social science is argued to be the dominant paradigm in mainstream communication inquiry in the United States. Its underlying basis is information theory. Communicology is a human science that differs from social science in that it focuses not on the message but rather the cultural-semiotic constraints on embodied phenomenological experience. This is a unique human science approach. The grounds for comparison are located in the history of these contrasting views and in their problematic concerns. American pragmatism and social psychology are depicted as analogous to European philosophy and the Geisteswissenschaften. As this essay argues, the human science of embodied discourse is historically rooted in semiotics and phenomenology and lead to a synthesis in contemporary communicology. Communicology is distinguished from cultural studies, and a vision for the future discipline is advanced. },

We have ranged across the humanities and social sciences to review the very best scholarship that these domains have produced which speaks to issues likely to concern the readers of the Journal of Marketing Management (JMM). These domains include: the history of marketing management, history of market research, history of market segmentation, product management history, retailing and channels history, promotion history, advertising history, the history of marketing thought, and marketing and the management of subjectivity, among others. Given obvious page limitations we have nevertheless tried to appeal to the paradigmatic span of the readers of the JMM. With this in mind, we have critically reviewed material that will be of interest to managerially oriented academics, as well as those who subscribe to consumer culture theoretics and critical marketing studies. },

@article{plotkindf,
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this essay is to argue that, for Veblen, the contribution of advertising to mature business enterprise was crucial. Although Thorstein Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class is widely credited with introducing the concept of “conspicuous consumption”, that book is silent on the contribution of the sales effort – or advertising – to such consumption. One must turn to Veblen’s later writings on the business system to find an analysis of advertising within oligopoly capitalism, what Veblen called the system of “absentee ownership”. At the beginning of the twentieth century business faced looming threats of technological progress and democratic discontent. The material prospect of accelerating productivity might soon “end the struggle or lessen the strain” of economic life; democracy might insist that the industrial system serve social needs in efficient ways. To ward off such challenges, business developed a two-prong approach to perpetuate scarcity: carefully managed control of output and an increasingly insistent, rationalized and expensive sales effort. The growth of advertising reflected a systematic expenditure of energy, talent and resources on a misdirection of human effort, one whose chief effect was to prolong “the strain” of everyday life in futile pursuit of waste. Whether such irrationality could be sustained indefinitely, or whether it might finally undermine the society that propels its pursuit, is an issue that Veblen raises, but to which he refuses to give any final answer. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyzes the full range of Veblen’s theoretical writings on consumption, technology and the sales effort. Findings – The paper insists that Veblen is the first radical political economist to provide a systematic critical analysis of advertising as an essential element of mature capitalism. Originality/value – The paper connects Veblen’s earliest thinking on “conspicuous consumption” to his mature analysis of advertising in the functioning of business enterprise. It will enrich understanding among academics and students, scholars of marketing and economic and social theorists, of Veblen’s critical analysis of the evolution of consumption, production and business enterprise.},

Design/methodology/approach – This article engages in a broad historical survey of the history of marketing thought, as it pertains to intellectual debate and disputation. Findings – While scholars often articulate objectivity as an intellectual ideal, many of the debates that are explored reveal a degree of intellectual intolerance and this is refracted through the institutional system that structures marketing discourse. Originality/value – This account provides an introduction to the intellectual debates of the last century, highlighting the ebb and flow of marketing thought.

I argue that he inherited this ambivalence from his Dissenting educational background, most especially the two-fold conception of truth that it negotiated.

Schutz laid stress on the We-relationship resulting from face-to-face performance of music, in which every listener participates with the other listeners, the performers, and the composers. Becker emphasized the existence of taken-for-granted conventions on which cooperative relations between performers are based, in conjunction with other members of the music subcommunity with whom they are engaged in a communication flow. The involved actors may participate in several reciprocally connected worlds of shared experiences, which if jointly considered constitute the art world. The theoretical and conceptual differences between Schutz and Becker, which concern their sociological writings on music, are related to analogous diversities between Phenomenological Sociology and Symbolic Interactionism. Finally, Weber, Honigsheim, and Adorno’s contributions to the sociology of music have been here considered for comparative purposes. },

Taking as a case study McLuhan's copies of James Joyce's Ulysses in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto, this article asks what we can learn about McLuhan's reading from close analysis of his own books. Analysis The article begins with a discussion of McLuhan's media theory as "applied Joyce, " with particular reference to Ulysses, and then turns to an overview of the annotation techniques and strategies visible in McLuhan's copies of the novel. Conclusion and implications The conclusion considers McLuhan's own books as hybrid artifacts that challenge us to rethink rigid distinctions between print and manuscript cultures. },

  abstract = {Background This article presents a reworked keynote address given at the "Many McLuhans" conference held at the University of Toronto in September 2018 on the occasion of UNESCO recognizing Marshall McLuhan's library as part of its Memory of the World program. Analysis The article explores McLuhan as a reader and suggests that his greatest work might have been what he read rather than what he wrote. Conclusion and implications The library, as a genre, is one of the great media forms of modernity and antiquity and a marker of the fragility and majesty of the things that humans do with their large brains.},

Results from the bibliometric network analyses of 91 journal articles and over 3000 citations reveals the structure of the invisible college of engagement research and identifies foundational and prominent publications. A close reading and analysis documents how these publications are influencing the theoretical development of engagement research in public relations.},

  abstract = {This study systematically analyzes Engineering of Consent (EOC)-focused scholarly papers published between 1947 and 2018 using content analysis and text mining. It aims to shed light on the progress of EOC research and related disciplines as well as the methodologies, data collection methods, major perspectives, and most frequent words used within these writings. Additionally, this study considers publications by region and the affiliations of first authors. The results show that only a small number of EOC-focused papers have been published since 1947; this area of public relations research has suffered from a lack of scholarly attention despite its relevance to various disciplines, and this is a situation that we hope improves. Recent trends have shown some reasons for optimism. We found that at least one EOC-focused paper has been published annually in most years since 2000 (the exceptions are 2001, 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2015). Our research shows that scholars in the fields of public relations, media studies, and political science published more papers on EOC than scholars in other fields. Research articles usually utilize qualitative research methodologies. Interviews stand out as the most widely used data collection method. Our analysis of publications by region and first-author affiliation shows that the majority of EOC papers were written by faculty and students working or studying in the United States. Seven perspectives frequently discussed by scholars and the most frequently used words within EOC papers are highlighted in a follow-up qualitative review.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on broadcast transcripts created by multilingual BBC monitors during the Second World War—which have received little scholarly attention—to consider how conflicting political discourses in wartime India were configured through the airwaves. As both Allied and Axis propaganda vied for the ‘hearts and minds’ of Indian audiences, how did the subcontinent become a geopolitical hotspot, particularly in 1942 with the threat of Japanese invasion, launch of the anticolonial Quit India movement and Subhas Chandra Bose’s nationalist broadcasts from pirate radio stations in Germany? This paper is interested in uncovering how the Indian listener would have ‘tuned in’, along with understanding monitors’ agency in selecting, editing, translating and transcribing these India-oriented transmissions. It seeks to broaden the frames of reference of broadcast history by focusing on non-European/non-US wartime listenership and surveillance, and argues for the value of BBC monitoring transcripts in interrogating the complex relationship between Indian decolonisation and war. },

  abstract = {Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, a Dutch government in exile was set up in London. One of the most important activities of these exiles was to make propaganda against the Nazi’s and throughout the war they operated Radio Oranje (Radio Orange), a wireless station that broadcasted to the Netherlands using BBC-transmitters. Another part of the Dutch broadcasting outfit in England was a ‘listening service’ that made daily reports about Dutch-language radio broadcasts from Hilversum by the Nazi regime. This article draws from a complete, and previously unused, set of these monitoring reports to analyse the Dutch propaganda war in the ether. The source material reveals that notions of Dutch neutrality were central to the radio broadcasts at both sides of the North Sea. In addition, the reports show how the London broadcasters singled out and targeted specific Nazi propagandists whom they thought to be the most dangerous. },

The results also reveal a dominance of the (post-)positivistic paradigm and quantitative methods. While the relative proportion of atheoretical research is decreasing, there is also a remarkable slowdown in new theory development. Finally, with a steep decline in federal funding, communication scholars are becoming more reliant on universities, public organizations, and private donors.}},

An American term, it indexed and communicatively advanced the problematization of media that took shape from the 1920s onward. Recently, scholars have debated the term’s continued relevance, typically without awareness of its history or international contexts of use. To provide needed background and enrich efforts to globalize the field, we offer a transnational history of mass communication, illuminating the sociological, cultural, and geopolitical dynamics of its emergence, dissemination, and reception. Mapping locations of its adoption, adaption, and rejection across world regions, we offer a methodology and a historical narrative to shed light on the early globalization of the field and lines of power and resistance that shaped it. We show how the term carries a residue of postwar American hegemony, and argue for greater reflexive awareness of our vocabularies of inquiry.}},

That issue probed the impact of this internationally acclaimed new wave at the zenith of its success. At a time of widespread enthusiasm for this countercinema, the editors expressed concerns about the ways in which many American critical treatments of recent West German cinema had “misread, ignored or distorted its place within the long range history and present context of the German Federal Republic.” By and large, these analyses, however well intentioned, focused on textual idiosyncrasies and gave short shrift to contextual determinants; for that reason they failed “to connect the aesthetics of contemporary filmmaking to the political and social traditions emerging from the Weimar and fascist periods” and to the production of culture within the West German public sphere.2}},

The present article provides an updated review of the academic literature devoted to the study of the Eurovision Song Contest which in the past two decades developed into a serious and rich academic field with four main areas: (1) studies of imagining a unified Europe – wherein I review research devoted to cosmopolitan European visions and nation branding; (2) studies focusing on gender and what is often referenced as gay or ‘camp’ features in the Eurovision Song Contest; (3) studies of Euro-Divisions which focus on political bloc voting and cultural alliances – exposing consistent and persistent rifts and coalitions in the celebration of European unity; and (4) studies making use of Eurovision data as a cultural seismograph for explaining external phenomenon like economic trade and political conflicts. Two decades of study of the Eurovision reveal that the ideal of unity is persistently challenged by national and cultural commitments. While commentators often deem the Eurovision Song Contest to be a silly kitsch show of musical mediocrity, this review proves it to be an appealing and productive area for the serious study of European civilization and its discontents. },

This transe/trance quality is explained via a discussion of the scientifically unexplainable, superstition, and the noumenal.

A decade later, what hath such research wrought? In the broad study of news and its digital transformation, few topics have captivated researchers quite like social media, with hundreds of studies on everything from how journalists use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat to how such platforms facilitate various forms of engagement between journalists and audiences. Now, some 10 years into journalism studies on social media, we need a more particular accounting of the assumptions, biases, and blind spots that have crept into this line of research. Our purpose is to provoke reflection and chart a path for future research by critiquing themes of what has come before. In particular, our goal is to untangle three faulty assumptions—often implicit but no less influential—that have been overlooked in the rapid take-up of social media as a key phenomenon for journalism studies: (1) that social media would be a net positive; (2) that social media reflects reality; and (3) that social media matters over and above other factors.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the intellectual development of cultural studies in Latin America in order to assess current challenges and identify lines of research. It is argued that much of the literature has failed to seriously consider key points of cultural studies, namely, the need to be critical about its own epistemological premises and the need to study culture within broad social formations. Since the landmark studies by N{\'e}stor Garc{\'i}a Canclini and Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero laid the foundations in the 1980s, the field of cultural studies has generally aimed to illustrate original arguments instead of using them as a point of departure to analyze media and cultural phenomena. Consequently, many scholars have produced work that while it proves and illustrates original arguments about the hybrid nature of cultures and the complexity of cultural mediation, it does not push the field in new theoretical directions. An additional problem is that, often, the study of culture has been divorced from a close inspection of the linkages between cultural, political, and economic processes, and from the articulations between high and low culture. Consequently, the political underpinnings of the enterprise of cultural studies, as outlined by Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall, have been in the background. This choice has, arguably, restrained the intellectual development and undermined the potential to move theory-building and the debate forward. Additionally, the disinterest in critically exploring theoretical premises has diminished the potential to transcend the boundaries of '' area studies'' in order to engage with the study of media and culture as well as cultural studies globally. The paper concludes by suggesting research directions that might contribute to overcoming the current intellectual impasse.},

  abstract = {This study examines the graduate training and research styles of some of Kurt Lewin's intellectual descendents. Specifically the question addressed was: What aspects of the social psychological environment at the Research Center for Group Dynamics while it was at MIT (1945-1948), enabled certain gifted students to develop the skills, enthusiasm and self-permission to be productive later in their careers and in turn, to foster younger scientists to do the same? Those aspect of Lewin's training which may have been responsible for the creative productivity of his intellectual descendents are the focus of this inquiry. These include the influence of Lewin's theory, the experimental method he brought to complex social phenomena as well as his personal style and approach to psychology. Twenty in-depth interviews were carried out and make up an oral history of the graduate training of some of Lewin's descendents. Those interviewed included three faculty members and six social psychologists who were graduate students at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. Also interviewed were eight social psychologists who were trained by members of the original MIT group, two social psychologists who were trained by one of the second generation Lewinians, and one social psychologist with close ties to the group. Some of the aspects of Lewin's training environment which were handed down by his students include: Immediate immersion in research with little emphasis on course work, an interdependent working style in which problem-solving research meetings known as the Quasselstrippe played a key part, task centeredness, intense scrutiny of data, self identification as scientists and use of an apprenticeship method of training. One model of graduate training is to purposefully train students in the art of scientific investigation in order to produce quality researchers. Another model, one followed by some members of the Lewin group, involves selecting the best students and carefully supervising them in order to produce quality research. Beginning with Lewin himself, training students has been a by-product of the pursuit of scientific understanding.},

Proponents say this is for the best, arguing that surveys bring the views of citizens closer to civic officials. Critics decry polling's promotion of sycophantic politicians who pander to the whims of public sentiment or conversely, the use of surveys by special interests to thwart the majority will. claims and criticisms were made during the early days of polling. When George Gallup began polling Americans in 1935, he heralded it as a bold step in popular democrat: The views of ordinary citizens could now be heard alongside those of organized interest groups. When brought to Canada in 1941, the Gallup Poll promised similar democratic rejuvenation. In actual practice, traditionally disadvantaged constituencies such as women, the poor, French Canadians in Canada, and African Americans in the United States were often heavily under-represented in Gallup surveys. Preoccupied with election forecasting, Gallup pollsters under-counted social groups thought less likely or unable to vote, leading to a considerable gap between the sampled polity and the general public. Examining the origins and early years of public opinion polling in Canada, Robinson situates polling within the larger context of its forerunners \textendash{} market research surveys and American opinion polling \textendash{} and charts its growth until its first uses by political parties.},

This article investigates the convergence of forces in that propelled this approach to its currently ascendant position. With a nod to Harvey J. Graff's analysis of the mythic power associated with the concept of literacy, the article explores the techniques and rationales that have coalesced around media literacy, making it at once central to the operation of neoliberal capitalism and to its critique. Putting media literacy into a longer history of the instrumental and biopolitical use of media in education and considering the role of education in connecting children's interests to moral and economic regulation, media literacy is taken to be the most recent iteration of a long-standing set of ideas that have been taken up in different ways by early educational reformers, postwar development communications theorists, and countercultural media educators.},

A new revisionist movement has emerged that challenges the dominant radical paradigms of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This has taken the form of contesting the underlying models of society, the characterization of media organizations, the representations of media content, the conception of the audience and the aesthetic judgements that underpinned much `critical' research. The author argues that this revisionism is in part a reversion to certain discredited conventional wisdoms of the past, a revivalism masquerading as new and innovatory thought. However, part of the new critique can be seen as a reformulation that could potentially strengthen the radical tradition of communications research.},

It is argued that marketing discourse should be viewed as an ordering attempt, not as an order. From this perspective it becomes important that we explore how marketing theory comes to be ordered in the way it presently is, and the manner in which certain ideas develop or face extinction, in order to better understand what can or cannot be said in market- ing theory. In response, this article argues that a much needed turn in the paradigm debate should be toward the exploration of the institutionalization of marketing theory. It examines the social, economic and institutional logic underpinning theory production in marketing and demonstrates the influence of McCarthyism and the Cold War climate on marketing theory.},

The data come from four main sources: (1) a survey conducted among Latin American scholars (N = 50), to determine their opinions about the origins, growth, and present state of communication research in the region; (2) a survey conducted among U.S. scholars with experience in Latin America (N = 51), to determine the same information as above but from a point of view that we suspect is somewhat different from that within the region; (3) a citation analysis of the main communication journals to determine the different intellectual influences on Latin American communication scholars; and (4) a content analysis of research published in seven major English language communication journals, and ten major Latin American journals to determine the main topics studied by each group of scholars. Structurally, this dissertation has seven parts. Chapter I introduces the topic and discusses the purpose, central research questions, and research methods. Chapter II deals with the way in which the different research traditions have grown in the region, as well as with the characteristics of the various studies conducted so far on the growth of communication research in Latin America. Chapter III describes the various methods of data collection and data analysis used in the present study. Chapters IV through VI present the major research findings regarding the following issues: (1) stages of development of communication research in Latin America, internal and external factors that determined the emergence of the discipline in the region, its milestones, and major changes over time; (2) major Latin American communication journals and research topics, most influential authors, and countries where research has been conducted; (3) main obstacles to communication research in Latin America, present state of the discipline, and expected changes for the near future. Finally, Chapter VII discusses the results at length, summarizes the main findings, considers some practical and theoretical implications of the study, and suggests further research.},

  abstract = {This article seeks to contribute to a cultural history of alternative media in the United States. It analyzes the relationships between major scholarship on alternative media and various historical contexts in order to discover various conceptions' limitations and possibilities. The value of such a study is not only how it recovers the variety of ways in which alternative media have been thought. By doing so, it also reminds readers of the necessary relation between theoretical conceptions and historical conditions remarked on by scholars. Such a study also reminds of the contingency of conceptions today, which typically emphasize separately or in combination (a) a kind of content, (b) a means of funding, or (c) the use of new technologies. The article begins by tracing the emergence and development of a dominant interpretive theory based in vanguardism, essentialism, and technological determinism, and concludes by discussing recent efforts that are grounded in materialist theories of culture and society. Such a change signals an ongoing project of generating understandings of alternative media that suggest the reciprocal relationships between modes of production, media forms, and oppositional, participatory practice.},

Over this time period, the desire for consumer products becomes figured by industry observers and researchers as a mode of children's "self expression." The analytic isolation of "the child" in the persona of a "consumer" authorizes a new morality for consumption by construing children's desire for goods as preexistent and thus natural.},

The book participates in a utopian imagination of society in which Jews and Gentiles alike would be centrally involved in the flow of communications. It turns from Gentile-style status toward Jewish-style connectivity as the basis of social power; defends socially grounded conceptions of mental life against Gentile individualism; insists in its notion of the two-step flow on the rabbinic principle that a text without a commentary is meaningless; and performs some amazing intellectual-moral-historical footwork with the most inconspicuous of all its central terms, '' people.''

It also compared those results with the results of a similar analysis of Journalism \& Mass Communication Quarterly (JMCQ) to find both Western and unique aspects of AJC. AJC scholarship has shown its Asian uniqueness by exploring social and cultural comparisons focusing on a few East Asian countries. It has also followed Western communication scholarship by investigating effects of political communication and news media, as well as advertising using television in the United States, similar to JMCQ. AJC contributes to mainstream mass communication scholarship while keeping its own Asian perspectives.},

  abstract = {The subject of this article is the emigration of German-speaking communication researchers after 1933 to the US and other countries. The article focuses on Zeitungswissenschaft (newspaper studies) in Weimar Germany and its lost works. Lost, because some of the most brilliant protagonists of this new academic field, which was first established in 1918 at the University of Leipzig, were refugees from Nazi Germany. Often, they were not able to enter an international setting of communication science due to the ruptures in their lives and careers. Their books have not been translated. These theoretical approaches were mainly of sociological impact and far from simple stimulus-response models. The Third Reich, with its aims of propaganda and lack of scientific relevance in the field, marked an end-point to a very innovative process-oriented way of thinking in early communication science in Germany. Most of the protagonists of this new thinking emigrated: for example, the sociologists Karl Mannheim and Ernest Manheim, the communication researchers Walter Auerbach and Gerhard M{\"u}nzner. This article outlines the theoretical background of early communication science in Germany and the context of racist and political persecution and emigration as a social and intellectual breakdown of this science. Actually, this breakdown gains new interest in the German academic community; the past of German communication science and its very dark sides have become topics of discussion and research.},

  abstract = {This article examines the intellectual history of the concept of 'publicity', originally defined by Immanuel Kant as the transcendental formula of public justice and the principle of the public use of reason, but later largely subsumed under the concept of 'freedom of the press'. The notion of the press as the Fourth Estate/Power was a valid concept and legitimate form of the institutionalization of the principle of publicity in the period when newspapers emanated from a new (bourgeois) estate or class: they had a different source of legitimacy than the three classic powers, and developed as a critical impulse against the old ruling estates. Yet the discrimination in favor of the power/control function of the press, which relates to the need of 'distrustful surveillance' defended by Bentham, clearly abstracted freedom of the press from the Kantian quest for the public use of reason. In democratic societies where the people rather than different estates legitimize all the powers, the control dimension of publicity embodied in the corporate freedom of the press should be effectively supplemented by actions toward equalizing private citizens in the public use of reason.},

Through comparative analyses of Bal{\'a}zs with the racial physiognomist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss as well as with Bal{\'a}zs's fellow Marxist Walter Benjamin, this article outlines key aspects of both right-wing and left-wing physiognomics. While Bal{\'a}zs did share with reactionary physiognomists the problematic idealist tendency to view the body as materialized soul, his views on physiognomy evaded racial essentialism, as he promoted cinematic physiognomics as a way to overcome boundaries of race and nation. Furthermore, Bal{\'a}zs and Benjamin used physiognomic perception to reconfigure social hierarchies and the relationship of spectators to technology and the material world, thus converting potentially reactionary concepts into ones that could be made serviceable for Marxism.},

Much of what they did in the following years (1935\textendash{}1948) was to promote both the political and scientific legitimacy of their enterprise. They sought to be recognized as the sole legitimate producers of public opinion. In this essay I examine the, mostly overlooked, rhetorical work deployed by the pollsters to publicize the scientific credentials of their polling activities, and the central role the concept of sampling has had in that pursuit. First, they distanced themselves from the failed straw poll by claiming that their sampling methodology based on quotas was informed by science. Second, although in practice they did not use random sampling, they relied on it rhetorically to derive the symbolic benefits of being associated with the '' laws of probability.''},

  abstract = {The authors examine two classic research studies from the 1950s: David Manning White's analysis of the "gatekeeper" news editor and Warren Breed's explanation of social control in the newsroom. Although posing a potentially radical question- "What makes news?"-these efforts were largely absorbed into and reinforced the limited media effects paradigm of the time. Drawing from interviews with the authors, the authors of this article trace the origin, impact, and intellectual context of these forerunners of media sociology. The authors argue that although these two studies were exceptions to the field's preoccupation with audience and effects, they nevertheless accepted and implicitly reinforced the prevailing media framework built around the commercial publishing and broadcasting industries. As such, they resemble much of the field's research, grounded as it has been in the "limited effects" reinforcement perspective of Lazarsfeld and the broader functionalist tradition of Merton. By calling the news construction process into question, both studies presented potential challenges to the "taken for granted" nature of the media.},

  abstract = {In this article, we trace the emergence of film criticism in Australia, from the period of its first appearance in the 1920s to its formalisation in the academy in the 1970s. Through an examination of trade, fan, newspaper and journal publications, we identify along the way four significant moments when broader industrial, public and institutional configurations gave rise to different kinds of film criticism: an 'independent commentary moment' (the 1920s), a 'film as film moment' (1930s), a 'film appreciation moment' (1950s\textendash{}1960s) and a 'production principle moment' (1970s). Each attended to some new way of taking up and being with film and is associated with its own particular array of practices. This historical trajectory of film criticism was characterised by increasing complexity and variety. Rather than replacing or displacing existing forms, each new form of film criticism built upon existing forms, produced new layerings and relations among critical forms. Using Bennett's [Making Culture, Changing Society (Abingdon, 2013), 125.] perspectives on the relation between culture and government, we identify film criticism as a form of expertise for adjudicating films and guiding their uptake. In this way, we show film criticism as being shaped not only by the shifting priorities of film and the film world, but also by broader contingencies of media, education and public culture. This lens reveals an important Australian difference when compared to the US, Britain and continental Europe: the Australian uptake of a film-as-film aesthetics in longer form film writing and reviewing is very much a response to and a consequence of the coming of sound rather than of the late silent period. We end with some remarks on the contribution this national trajectory of film reviewing made to the formation of film writing in the Australian academy and to the revival of Australian film-making, which both began in earnest in the 1970s.},

Landowners and social reformers are among those who worked on the methods of social surveys. Journalists, psychologists, and sociologists contributed to the fashioning of questionnaires. Sampling theory was developed by astronomers, mathematicians, and economists, while the methods of data analysis were devised by statisticians, psychologists, and sociologists. All this, when coupled with modern technology, makes polling an indispensable tool of politics, business, and the mass media today.},

  abstract = {The principal aim of this study is to offer an historical reconstruction of the genesis of radical cultural studies. In practice this project has entailed the construction of a progressively-written account of the intellectual development of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies from the time of its establishment in 1964 and, especially, during the period of the politicisation of its project from the historical conjuncture of 1968 onwards through to the mid-1970s. Integral to the realising of this aim has been the development of an interpretation of the Centre's radical project as having constituted a counter-intellectual critique; that is, and interrelated ensemble of delegitimating, legitimating and reflexive critiques. It will be shown that this interpretation emerges from the Centre's intellectual history over the periods of its development considered and that, in retrospect, it can be discerned in the terms in which the Centre critically transformed its own project. The study begins with a critical consideration of two reconstructive approaches to cultural studies\textendash{}those of historical reconstruction and reconstructive critique. After this point of departure attention is immediately focussed on the originating formulation and the initial reception of the Birmingham Centre's project. This is followed by a chapter devoted to the critical practice of its founder Richard Hoggart. Two chapters on the Centre's engagement with sociology then ensue and this leads to a consideration of the radicalisation of its project which emphasises the turn towards Marxism that it involved. Next the elements of a reconstructive critique of radical cultural studies are presented using the components of a counter-intellectual critique theoretically constructed for this purpose conjoined with a perspective on three kinds of knowledge-constitutive interests. A brief discussion on the derivation and use of the term counter culture is also given. Lastly the study reconsiders reconstructive approaches to cultural studies with special reference to the topic of deep interpretation. The study ends with some reflections on cultural studies and its 'shadow'.},

Past my detailed explication of Luhmann?s key concepts, I register my deep disagreements with his philosophy and speculate about why his treatise may have suffered neglect within EC.

  abstract = {The division of the communication discipline according to whether people communicate face-to-face or via a technological medium has shaped the field's development from the outset. The divide has been institutionalized over time in the structures of academic departments and schools, professional training and degrees, scholarly societies and publishing, and in the field's larger research agendas. However, critics inside and outside the field have long insisted that the differences between the two subfields actually obscure the shifting, contingent nature of communication in everyday experience, social formations, and culture. This paper traces efforts to theorize the intersection of interpersonal and media communication, and in particular the concept of mediation, from Lazarsfeld and Katz's two-step flow in the 1950s, to the challenge of digital media technologies in the 1970s and 1980s, to the rise of new media studies and digital culture scholarship from the 1990s onward.},

The five primary findings reveal that: 1) publication of new media research continues to diffuse, with the subfield likely to have reached a critical mass and passed through an adoption 'take off' phase; 2) authors favor a concentrated set of title keyword terms to describe their research; 3) media-oriented journals publish approximately half of all new media articles; 4) a core set of 14 communication-related journals currently publishes new media research; and 5) the principles of mediamorphosis and diffusion of innovations help to explain the emergence of the new media concentration within the communication discipline. We conclude that new media research focusing on the internet and related digital technologies is currently a formalized and self-sustaining area of study within the discipline.},

Ong was drawn to Hopkins in large part for the bearing of his writing on the evolution of human consciousness. Ong discovered in his Master's thesis on Hopkins' sprung rhythm \textendash{} written under Marshall McLuhan \textendash{} that Hopkins was in some sense hearing in advance the sounds of what would become twentieth-century modernism. Hopkins displayed a sensibility and awareness that were compelling for the modernist writers of the twentieth century, as they carried out their experiments with finding new voices, new ways of writing poetry for the changed world in which they found themselves. Hopkins' feel for the distinctive self, seeking connection with other selves in the uncertainties of time, played no small role in this appeal. Ong's work on Hopkins is a model for both literary criticism and studies in the evolution of consciousness.},

  abstract = {Media archaeological methods for extending the lifetime of new media into 'old media' have experienced a revival during the past years. In recent media theory, a new context for a debate surrounding media archaeology is emerging. So far media archaeology has been articulated together with such a heterogeneous bunch of theorists as Erkki Huhtamo, Siegfried Zielinski, Thomas Elsaesser and to a certain extent Friedrich Kittler. However, debates surrounding media archaeology as a method seem to be taking it forward not only as a subdiscipline of (media) history, but increasingly into what will be introduced as materialist media diagrammatics. This article maps some recent media archaeological waves in German media theory. The text addresses Wolfgang Ernst's mode of media archaeology and his provocative accounts on how to rethink media archaeology as a fresh way of looking into the use and remediation of media history as a material monument instead of a historical narrative and as a recent media theoretical wave from Germany that seems to not only replicate Kittler's huge impact in the field of materialist media studies but develop that in novel directions. However, as will be argued towards the end, Ernst's provocative take that hopes to distinguish itself as a Berlin brand of media theory in its hardware materiality and time-critical focus resonates strongly with some of the recent new directions coming from US media studies, namely in software and platform studies.},

This article provides one observer's perspective on the evolution of the discipline: literature, theory, and practice. The creation and growth of ISAGA are also referenced. Early computer simulations failed at prediction due to limitations of theory, data, and technology. Their lack of transparency limited their value for expository purposes. Through time, a design methodology has emerged to guide the creation of simulation games to improve communication in complex policy decision environments. These instruments are not intended to be predictive; rather, their primary objective is to help a group achieve consensus through the multilogue mode of communication. Several simulation/games are outlined to illustrate the progression of the discipline.},

These tensions\textemdash{}having to do with notions of textuality and authority, consumption and children's agency and citizenship and power\textemdash{}point to lacunae in the field of children's media studies.

The NFS served a crucial function by coordinating access of films to schools and public life, often on behalf of the NFB. Assisting this coordination was an obscure and short-lived organization, the Canadian Film Committee. The CFC and the NFS helped to tilt the idea of national film projects toward an educational discourse, one that highlighted issues of citizenship over other alternatives for national film culture.},

He hoped to complement the standard histories of sociology that dwell exclusively on social theory with the history of the other, equally important, empirical roots of the discipline. Lazarsfeld thought that institutional support for social research would be more readily forthcoming if the long and interesting history of empirical sociology became better known.},

Gilroy has been a trenchant critic of the early British cultural-studies tradition, but his simultaneous attention to structure and agency, focus on modes of dominance and resistance, privileging of historicity and counterhistory, and exploration of the politics of representation, suggests connections with that tradition as well. In stretching and reconceiving the cultural Marxist tradition, Gilroy has simultaneously demonstrated its continued legacy for historical theory and practice.},

Four themes emerged from the analysis: education, professionalisation and gender; theory and practice; developing academic legitimacy and practitioner perspectives in the curriculum. Participants understood education within a professional narrative, that is, as offering a way of establishing Australian public relations as a distinct field of expertise and confirming its professional status. The findings offer new insights into the development of Australian public relations education as it became established as a popular course of study and the role of PRIA in the constitution and transmission of public relations knowledge.},

One of the central contradictions of the Decatur Study is that it simultaneously disguises that it is women who are being studied here yet universalizes them as representative of the general population. But the article also argues that despite the blind spots and ahistoricity of Personal Influence, it was a crucial reminder that women, despite being individual targets of much media fare, were also embedded in social networks through which they influenced other women and were, in turn, influenced by them.},

Our analysis identified five relatively independent research traditions addressing this construct.

Through that decade many intellectuals who became leaders in Australian Cultural Studies and important players in Cultural Studies outside of Australia worked in Perth. Among them were John Fiske, John Frow, John Hartley, Tom O'Regan, Lesley Stern, Graeme Turner and, a decade later, Ien Ang. This essay discusses the presence of these academics in Perth and advances some reasons why Perth became so important to Cultural Studies in Australia. It also discusses the kind of Cultural Studies that became privileged in Perth and considers some of the reasons for this. Perth Cultural Studies in the 1980s was primarily text-based and focused on screen-related popular culture, especially television programs and popular film. Cultural Studies in Perth developed in a city thought of as marginal to Australia, in institutions that were either not universities or, in the case of Murdoch University, was a very new university, by cosmopolitan academics who mostly came from either elsewhere in Australia or from the United Kingdom.},

Against the common identification of the project of classical film theory with commitment to essentialist notions of medium specificity, the article demonstrates the theorists' concern with intermedial issues of exchanges between film and other media. Drawing on examples from the engagement with the newly emergent medium of radio in canonical texts by the three theorists, the article discusses the influence of radio on theorizing about the unique properties of film, its aesthetic possibilities, and course of development. The article finally argues that the vast dynamic changes in the mediascape of the 1920s and 1930s, which saw the coming of sound film, the emergence of radio, and the first demonstrations of television technology, necessitated classical film theorists to adopt intermedial perspectives similar to those that are commonplace in today's writings on digital cinema and new media.},

The conversation initially deals with the socio-cultural context in which the 'Visual Pleasure...' essay was produced by outlining a number of possible theoretical parallelisms with other scholars, from Foucault to Barthes to Goffman. Then, on the basis of Mulvey's latest book, Death 24\texttimes{} a Second, and of a variety of contemporary examples, the emphasis is on the relative shift in Mulvey's work from gender to time and visual technology. Finally, the conversation focuses on the concept of 'gendered scopic regime' and the potential re-articulation of the male gaze through the technological re-direction and control of the visual.},

  abstract = {While 'cultural studies is caught in a traffic jam', at the same time the seemingly global crisis of cultural studies coincides with the late reception and high popularity of cultural studies in the German-speaking countries after the 'cultural' and the 'linguistic turns'. Yet, the political and academic history and the contexts of the emergence of cultural studies and 'Kulturwissenschaften', as well as their by now established academic traditions and the manifold relations to current developments, are rarely defined and scrutinized. In this paper,we will relate some theoretical and historical perspectives concerning the relationship between cultural studies and the historical disciplines in the German-speaking context. We shall try to trace the potential of mutual benefits between cultural studies and history by foregrounding the political commitment of academic work that still seems to be one of the most important traits of CS as much as the necessity of a stronger notion of the contextualization that history and historiographical methodology provides.},

At the same time, the globalization of media combined with the globalization of higher education means that the research and teaching of the subject faces immediate and profound challenges, not only as the subject of enquiry but also as the means by which researchers and students undertake their studies.Edited by a leading scholar of global communication, this collection of essays by internationally-acclaimed scholars from around the world aims to stimulate a debate about the imperatives for internationalizing media studies by broadening its remit, including innovative research methodologies, taking account of regional and national specificities and pedagogic necessities warranted by the changing profile of students and researchers and unprecedented growth of media in non-Western world.Transnational in its perspectives, Internationalizing Media Studies is a much-needed guide to the internationalization of media and its study in a global context.},

  abstract = {Deleuze's cinema books are often understood as adopting a Bergsonian framework while rejecting phenomenological accounts of film experience for equating 'cinematographic perception' with 'natural perception'; or, alternatively, simply as being a phenomenological inquiry. Reading Deleuze's comments on, and references to, phenomenology in the cinema books (especially Merleau-Ponty, Laffay, and Dufrenne), this paper argues that while not following a phenomenological logic in general, at certain moments the cinema books' Bergsonian account intersects with phenomenology. Moreover, in the books, the existence of movement-images in the cinema depends on the spectator's experience of watching films. The logic explaining this encounter is indebted to the account of the experience of art and cinema in phenomenology which Deleuze combines with the discussion of 'real' movements in Bergson's Creative Evolution. This reliance on a specific 'passive' viewer's experience can explain the books' limited interest in early cinema and in television, video, and the digital image.},

  abstract = {Abstract This article, a cultural history, attempts to answer the question of how John B. Watson's presence at J. Walter Thompson ?made sense* from the standpoint of the actors involved. At the time Watson joined the agency, he had achieved a national reputation as a psychologist, a researcher, and the leader of behaviorist psychology. His doctrine, which recognized prediction and control as the goal of psychology, meshed well not only with broader Progressive concerns of social control, but more particularly with the goals of the business community, and at J. Walter Thompson, with the goals of Stanley B. Resor. Watson's presence at the agency became a *mechanism* through which Resor could implement his philosophy into advertising practice. Watson's work was to help rationalize the advertising process, but at the same time, spoke directly to the admirers of science, legitimating a reality in which decision making based upon *scientific* methods assumed a role of prominence.},

For almost 40 years, from 1970 to 2009, a journalism diploma was mandatory to work in a newsroom. As part of the field of Applied Social Sciences, journalism remains popular among the young generation: The demand for undergraduate bachelor's programs has attracted fairly high levels of enrollment in the last three decades. For the purposes of this article, we analyze the application of the 2013 Guidelines for Journalism Education to verify whether bachelor's programs in journalism include or neglect an important axis in the process of instruction: knowledge of the world and the intellectual challenges of journalistic routines, as suggested in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Model Curricula for Journalism Education.},

Hall (1959), the American anthropologist who wrote The Silent Language and founded the field of intercultural communication, exchanged over 133 letters during the period between 1962 and 1976. Their correspondence provides insight into the evolution of such important ideas as the conception of the media as extensions of man, media technological determinism, and McLuhan's dictum that the medium is the message. Although these ideas are usually attributed to McLuhan, who wrote about them in two important books, The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) and Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1965), Hall had considerable influence in their development. Although Harold Innis is widely acknowledged for shaping McLuhan as a communication technological determinist, the exchange between Hall and McLuhan helped develop the latter's theory about the impacts of communication technology on the human senses. Here we see how important intellectual ideas often grow out of communication between scholars, allowing them to test and extend their thinking in a collaborative mode.},

Additional topics include scene processing and the E-Z Reader model. Rayner's legacy and the impact he had on students and colleagues are described. Keith Rayner's extraordinary scientific career revolutionized the field of reading research and had a major impact on almost all areas of cognitive psychology. In this article, we review some of his most significant contributions. We begin with Rayner's research on eye movement control, including the development of paradigms for answering questions about the perceptual span and its relationship to attention, reading experience, and linguistic variables. From there we proceed to lexical processing, where we summarize Rayner's work on effects of word frequency, length, predictability, and the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Next, we turn to syntactic and discourse processing, covering the well-known garden-path model of parsing and briefly reviewing studies of pronoun resolution and inferencing. The next section shifts from language to visual cognition and reviews research which makes use of eye movement techniques to investigate object and scene processing. Next, we summarize Rayner and colleagues' approach to computational modeling, with a description of the E-Z Reader model linking attention and lexical processing to eye movement control. The final section discusses the issues Rayner and his colleagues were focused on most recently and considers how Rayner's legacy will continue into the future.},

However, this story occludes other, decidedly undemocratic, foundational ideas that were at the heart of rhetoric and oratory during the first half of the twentieth century. Given contemporary concerns with both deliberative democracy and affect theory, rhetoricians and speech teachers would benefit today from a fuller understanding of some of the undemocratic ideas that influenced the modern rhetorical renaissance. This article helps accomplish this by focusing on the work of Gustave Le Bon, whose concern with persuasion and the masses was influential on early scholars of rhetorical oratory, including James Winans, William Brigance, and James O?Neill. Indeed, it was Gustave Le Bon who popularized the notion that the masses were like a psychological crowd devoid of reason and the ability to deliberate.},

I argue that liberal feminism, which characterizes much U.S. mainstream media research, speaks only to white, heterosexual, middle and upper class women and is incapable of addressing most women's concerns. Radical and structuralist feminist communication scholars, however, tend to focus exclusively on texts and often ignore important contextual considerations. I conclude that socialist feminism offers the greatest potential for a comprehensive framework to address women's devaluation in communication but that much more theoretical and empirical work still needs to be done. Finally, I encourage the recent tendency among feminist communication scholars to ignore disciplinary boundaries and draw freely on literary, film, and speech studies, as well as mass communication and feminist theory.},

  abstract = {One of the questions addressed by the colloquium focused on the changing status and character of communication and media studies in universities. This article follows that institutional perspective about communication research in general and critical media studies in particular. First the evolution of the field since the 1950s is reviewed through a number of stages, which coincide with the history of leftist thinking \textendash{} six ferments, one for each decade. Then the disciplinary nature of the field is discussed, with special reference to the ongoing reform of higher education in Europe known as the '' Bologna process.'' An illustrative case is provided by a survey of the field in the Scandinavian countries. The conclusion is that there is a need for radical reflection about the discipline in the contemporary world, calling for an approach to media studies in terms of the philosophy of science. The article presents notes for further thought rather than suggests final scenarios, and this is done from an admittedly personal and national perspective \textendash{} as a veteran of the field and as a member of the Finnish community.},

  abstract = {The work of Erving Goffman has been influential in media studies, primarily via adaptations of selected concepts like ?region? and ?frame.? However, relatively little attention has been paid by media researchers to Goffman's own theoretical work on the mass media. Taking its lead from the later work of Goffman, this essay shows how it contains elements of a theoretical framework for mass-mediated communication, through the concepts of ?hyper-ritualization? and ?dramatic scriptings.? I emphasize the way that Goffman situates mass communication in relation to the interpersonal realm as a model version of the latter, as mass communication is crafted, concentrated, and planned to a degree that interpersonal communication is not. I conclude that Goffman's critical approach to informality in broadcast talk and interaction is a valuable tool for the researcher in a time when the rhetoric of informality has become a dominant mode of legitimation in broadcasting.},

Rogers' key theoretical and conceptual contributions to the social sciences are discussed, focusing especially on his seminal work on the diffusion of innovations. The article argues that Rogers' life journey represents the quintessential intercultural life: a poor, Iowa farm boy who became an internationally recognized global intellectual; a scholar, who theorized about both macro- and micro-aspects of social change and provided a heuristic framework with remarkable potential for field-based application; a sense-maker who remained solidly anchored in the field of diffusion of innovations, but who continually deepened and extended his curiosity to other areas such as communication networks, entertainment\textendash{}education, and international, intercultural, health, and organizational communication; a prodigious mentor who affirmed, validated, and challenged his students to pursue unasked or intriguing questions; a genuine networker who understood the social capital advantages of learning from heterophilous others, affirming and embodying the value of diversity; a global citizen who traveled widely, learned other languages, lived for extended durations in faraway lands, and who maintained a sense of humanity and humility in his interactions with others. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Rogers' life journey was quintessentially intercultural: a poor, Iowa farm boy to internationally recognized global intellectual. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A scholar-practitioner, who theorized and engaged with both macro- and micro-aspects of social change. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A networker, who understood the social capital advantages of learning from heterophilous others. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} A global citizen, who traveled, learned languages, and cultivated humanity and humility in his diverse interactions.},

The results reveal a weak academic culture that contrasts with a strong professional culture among the members of this community, but also the influence that both organizational and individual variables have on Chilean JMC educators' orientations. Specifically, the analyses indicated that the level of education, part-time/full-time commitment, and the type of university are the most influential factors in defining both the prevalence of a professional culture and the lack of research productivity. These findings support other international studies, indicating a global tendency across key variables that influence academic development in the field. Likewise, it shows how distant Chilean JCM educators are from the university-scholarly tradition.},

Here I argue for a politics of the emergent, an increasing turn towards the negotiation of the possible, the drawing in of trans-national frames, and the reformulation of theories of race in the aftermath of resistance politics. Studies of popular culture during this period increasingly come to be superseded by a focus on public culture and on circulation.

  abstract = {The article presents an interview of Archibald Crossley, founder of Crossley Surveys Inc. On asking about the problems and issues that researchers had to face in earlier days Crossley said that the problems were considerable because there was almost no marketing information at the time. There were very few books on marketing, and just a few books on advertising. The census data was very limited information in the census and it was out of date at that particular time. There was almost nothing at that time on the number of readers of a magazine or even the number of people that got a magazine. What happened then was that the publishers would issue what they call "publishers' statements of circulation." The trouble was that sometimes those statements consisted only of the number of copies printed. Answering to a question related to the problems and issues that the research community is facing today, he said that one of the greatest problems is the completion rate in surveying, particularly with the probability sampling method in which call-backs are required. The completion rate has gone down. It's becoming much more difficult to get interviews.},

These early studies, conducted from the 1920s to the 1960s, were the foundation upon which the field of communication studies was built. A paradigm shift in the late 1940s, which firmly took hold in the 1960s, led to the abandonment of this field and the valuable results it yielded. However, propaganda studies could be examined using current theories of mass communication effects.},

Drawing on his letters to the Corinthians and other early groups of Christ-followers, I argue that Paul used eloquent mediated rhetoric to conceptualize local ritual practice in such a way that it could form the basis for widespread solidarity and mass community in a geographically expanding religious sect. This was a form of mass communication centered in dispersed bodily assemblies and radiating outward to encompass ever wider regions of a distended mass society. It hinged on the Body of Christ, which in Paul's letters became a space- and time-binding medium of mass communication that held together a dispersed society of the Christ-proclaiming faithful. Paul was essentially an early medium theorist, and I argue that his bifocal attention to local assembly and distant solidarity is instructive for both the study and social practices of mass communication today.},

As a communicative phenomenon and research object, social media would appear to be in flux. Changes to existing services, the emergence of new services, and the disappearance of previously popular services testify to the sense of social media as a moving target. Researchers of social media seem to accept change, rather than continuity, as a condition for the study of social media. This is evident in our choice of research topics and data sources, but also in our discourses on social media. By examining the sense of flux of social media research in a historical perspective, this article aims to provide useful directions for future media and communication research on social media. Specifically, it suggests ways to stabilise social media as an object of study and to install a greater historical awareness in social media research.},

  abstract = {Main characteristics, challenges, current practices and future directions of mass communication research are examined from a sociology of science perspective to determine the influence of theory, method and utility to government and industry decision makers on the development of future directions of research activity in this field. Intellectual underpinnings for theory, method and utility for mass communication research activity are traced through the more established social sciences which from the 1930s through the 1960s were based on fairly stable pragmatist and behavioral assumptions. However, by the 1970s when anticipated theories and procedures of this orientation had not gone unchallenged alternate philosophies and research approaches with new perspectives on the purposes of social science research began to receive greater attention from North American scholars. Mass communication, distinctly American social science which developed during the era of stability, had by the 1970s also experienced the repercussions of challenge and disaffection with a positivist, behavioral research orientation. The degree to which challenges have affected mainstream research activity by the 1980s is examined from the perspective of the influence of funding, sponsorship arrangements and university setting. Nine hypotheses concerning the impact of institutional structures on research activity and researcher perspectives on the field are tested through survey techniques. Nominal data was gathered relative to the recent past, present, and planned future research activity of mass communication researchers affiliated with major and minor American universities. Statistical analysis using Chi-Square provided partial confirmation for the research hypotheses which posit a disassociation between the primary research activity of scholars and what they perceive as the most relevant approaches and areas for research innovation in the field. Developed as a service oriented field, mass communication research appears to continue following the original directions for research activity. However, researchers also seem to be aware and concerned about the limitations of the research agenda and supportive of developing theories, procedures and structures for more actively pursuing alternate approaches to research activity.},

Within this context, I expound a conception of communication based on ideas in information theory and on Niklas Luhmann's systems theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the context dependency of utterances. At the same time, I introduce readers to Luhmann's version of systems theory, which is becoming more and more influential in German literary theory. The view of communication expounded here implies that as all meaning is founded on difference, an utterance can acquire meaning only by differing from other utterances, that is, by negating other positions. Therefore, the context is always part of the utterance; it enters, so to speak, into the utterance. At issue here is a specific type of context, a specific axis of difference, correlated with the utterance in a particular way. I try to show exactly how this specific conceptualization of the relation between meaning and context, between communication and difference, is to be understood. First, I discuss the systems theoretical concept of communication and illustrate it with several examples taken largely from political and literary communication. Next, I address the way this concept of communication and difference diverges from (post)structuralist theories, to which it might seem to bear some resemblance. Finally, I examine the difficult question of the relationship between communicative utterances, contexts, and their place within social systems, focusing especially on Luhmann's conceptualization of the art system.},

Williams sought to distinguish questions of technique and technical invention from their realization in the fundamentally social organization of technologies themselves and emphasized the importance of agency and intention in structuring the uses to which technologies are put. Far from technology having an inescapable internal logic of development, innovation takes place within specific social and economic contexts. For Williams, this meant that there was no pre-determined outcome to the evolution of communications innovations but a series of complex interactions between innovations and the world into which they emerge. This article will provide an assessment of Williams' work on technological innovation, his critique of determinism and his commitment to democratic communications. Williams helps us to challenge the simplistic proposition that 'the Internet has changed our world' and enables us to understand instead the ways in which contemporary social relations set limits on the development of the Internet as a democratic medium.},

Focusing on the treatment of the disembodied voice by various theorists, three trends can be identified: borrowing from semiology and narratology, an essentially descriptive approach first emerges that creates a new vocabulary to talk about sound and analyze the links between sound and image. A second approach emphasizes the possible meanings of the disembodied voice, a trend heavily influenced by Lacanian theories and their later adaptations by feminist film theorists. Finally, some researchers have opted for semio-pragmatic or cognitive approaches that take into account the experience of audiences. These different approaches underline the way film sound has evolved as an object of study, to be considered as a complex and flexible phenomenon. They also have developed tools that can be applied to other audiovisual media in which the role of sound and the voice should not be underestimated.},

  abstract = {Fan studies as a discipline is still in its infancy. But even given this nascence, there have been significant shifts in the ways that it has theorized, studied and investigated fans over the first two and a half decades of research. As scholarship, fan studies has moved away from ethnographic investigations of fans as the main object of study to focus instead on the output of fan discourse as the key mode of examination. At the same time, scholars like Henry Jenkins and Matt Hills, both central to the discipline, have opened dialogue about the nature of the fan/academic, often called the `aca-fan'. This article uses the lens of aca-fandom to analyse fan answers to interview questions at a large Midwestern Doctor Who convention. Fans were asked about the role that fan studies has played in their life, how they perceive the study of fans and whether fan studies as an academic discipline has an effect on their fandom. The fans' answers reflect a critical awareness of fandom but a general ignorance of fan studies. This article argues three points to take away from this. First, fan studies needs to refocus attention back onto fans themselves through ethnographic work. Second, the discipline needs to refocus its output less on esoteric academic titles and more on popular venues. Finally, fans and academics should engage in specific dialogue to open up avenues for new fannish and academic exploration.},

The article intends to review the context and nature of critical media and communication studies, seen through the author's personal experience in national as well as international spheres. While the testimony is autobiographical, an attempt is made to contemplate career development from the outside unlike in conventional memoires. This article is a prelude to a reflective review of the author's professional and political life story, forthcoming as a book in Finnish. The introduction gives examples of the use of the term '' critical'' in the field of media and communication studies, followed by a review of different ways in which the critical concept is used in the literature of the field, leading to a reflection on the precarious relationship between the intellectual and the political. A personal testimony by the author then provides a case illustrating how a scholar becomes critical under the influence of philosophical, political and international factors. The discussion at the end offers some concluding reflections.},

In recognizing the feminist influence in the development of cultural studies, it is also important to acknowledge that this implicates feminism in an approach that often overcompensates for traditional Marxism's determinism and neglect of cultural experience by ignoring the structural constraints imposed by political and economic realities. This article traces the developments between feminism and Marxism and cultural studies and political economy, suggesting that the answer to the problem of separate spheres is not to populate one sphere at the expense of the other. Rather, what is needed is a feminist political economy that reconciles the insights of '' the politics of representing the Other'' with a much-needed material dimension that only a political economy approach can provide.},

The first approach is represented by social scientists, who, with some exceptions, seek to understand the effects of games on users. The second approach is favored by humanists, who seek to understand the meaning and context of games. To date, these two groups have largely talked past one another due to their different goals and their different methodologies. Yet, for the advancement of science and understanding, both sets of scholarship are important and relevant. Each has contributions to make. However, unless these two groups come to possess at least a cursory understanding of the other's methodology, there will be little synthesis. This is a missed opportunity for scholars of every stripe, and ways are suggested to bridge these gaps.!},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to examine the way American businesses and marketers used research to shape the concept of the consumer at the turn of the twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} A historical, cultural approach is used to examine published and unpublished writings of economists, marketers, researchers, and publishers from the 1880s to about 1930. The primary focus is Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies' Home Journal, and creator of one of the first market research departments in the USA. Findings \textendash{} The argument is made that publishers and advertisers took the values of a republic, values which has long empowered and idealized white property owners, and redefined those values in terms of buying ability. In doing so, they embed many biases in their market research, yet gave businesses a working concept of the consumer and helped shape society's ideals of the consumer. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} As with all historical research, it is limited by the primary sources that have survived and are available. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper shows how early market research can provide an important perspective into the making of a consumer society, and how it can be used by historians and current practitioners to understand the methods, biases, and assumptions that have guided marketers and market research.},

It makes that case by reconstructing persistent political economic dimensions in the work of Charles Horton Cooley, who more than anyone else de-serves to be called the intellectual founder of communication study in the U.S. Drawing out previously neglected aspects of Cooley's thought, it sketches how his pragmatist, social democratic brand of political economics took a holis-tic, historically informed view of the communicative constitution and social or-ganization of selves, institutions, and political cultures. Cooley provides a starting point for a revised understanding of the history of political economic thinking about communication and ways that it has intersected with sociology, cultural study, and democratic theory},

As a consummate educator, he influenced generations of communication students and professionals to put the creation of meaning at the center of communication. Dean emphasized that this required us to integrate multiple disciplines and to make a commitment to both the humanistic and scientific paradigms. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Dean Barnlund synthesized humanities and the scientific paradigm to examine culture. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} Meaning-centered communication is transactional, reflexive, and context-bound. {\^a}\textordmasculine{} The focus of intercultural communication is on process, not content.},

In response, this article reads scientometric data and game studies editorials, handbooks, and introductions through the lens of interdisciplinarity studies to assess game studies' status as an interdiscipline. It argues that game studies show drivers and hurdles typical for interdisciplines. Yet instead of establishing themselves as the broad umbrella interdiscipline of digital game research, they are becoming one narrow cultural studies multidiscipline within the growing and diversifying field of game research and education. Researchers from fields like human\textendash{}computer interaction or communication are abandoning game studies venues in favor of disciplinary ones\textemdash{}ironically thanks to game studies legitimizing game research. This article suggests that a design orientation and cross-disciplinary boundary objects such as middle range theories could help to broaden, deepen, and secure future interdisciplinary game research.},

This new literature suggests that the entirety of McLuhan's works represents a subtle critique of liberal capitalism and a call for a new emancipatory vision. For this reason, many scholars working in this literature see McLuhan as a man of the left. Although there is a discernible anti-capitalistic politics in McLuhan's works, this article will argue against the position that his anti-capitalism is rooted in leftism. Indeed, McLuhan critiques the liberal, individualistic and capitalistic print age from the right-wing side of the political spectrum. McLuhan's writings on tribalism reveal the hope that a new right-wing postmodern community will be reconstructed. Such a retrieval of the past is postmodern, since technology and myth are the forces which, McLuhan hoped, would construct this new right-wing political space.},

  abstract = {Though not as well-known as other of his writings, Robert K. Merton's communications research represents an important body of work. From 1941, when he first joined forces with Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University, through 1949, when he published his last articles in the area, Merton was active in the overlapping fields of propaganda, public opinion, and communications research. He codified methods, formulated middle range concepts, and composed a small but distinctive corpus that remains useful for contemporary study. Borrowing one of Merton's own concepts, this essay argues that his communications research was serendipitous\textemdash{}an unplanned, surprising, but highly productive episode in his nine-decade 'life of learning'. Not only was communications research the vehicle through which he and Lazarsfeld initially forged their famous partnership, it also helped Merton advance his own sociological thinking and yielded some of the best work on mass media published before 1950. Following the logic of the idea of serendipity, I trace the development of Merton's communications research from his unplanned preparation in the 1930s, through the structured opportunity he ambivalently embraced working with Lazarsfeld during the war, and on to some of the more significant consequences that followed.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an intellectual history of the media sociology of the 1970s and early 1980s, as epitomized by a selection of newsroom ethnographies (the '' newsroom studies'') that were published during this time. With a focus on the United States, I identify several discourses in both the intellectual and broader socio-political context that were contemporary with the research and whose influences can be seen in these seminal studies. In particular: organizational theory\textemdash{}of the Marxist variety, a critique of professionalism, and the social construction of reality; as well as a broad rejection of institutional authority and a liberal call for pluralism. Having identified these influences, I ask what sort of blind spots this historically specific intellectual constellation produced, and how these blind spots still influence the media sociology of today. I conclude that the intellectual and socio-political contexts of the newsroom studies led their authors to over-emphasize organizational constraints, and to focus narrowly on the most influential news outlets and their official sources; contemporary ethnographies have placed greater emphasis on journalistic agency and on the networked nature of newswork, though I question whether an emphasis on organizational constraints is not still politically warranted.},

@phdthesis{soukup_term_1985,
  abstract = {The uses of the word, 'medium,' in communication research from 1920 through 1940 reveal a complex background of philosophical and historical development. By examining 'medium' and its development, this study argues that communication research carries with it the traces of a varied set of philosophical assumptions, many problematic and most unexamined. This varied background to contemporary work demands that the terminology of the area of study be placed in its historical, social, and disciplinary context. During the early period of communication research, 'medium' draws on four clusters of meaning: meanings associated with physical connection, meanings associated with representatives and representation, meanings associated with social formation and a social environment, and meanings associated with a secondary, instrumental, function. Educators, writers, and communication practitioners apply 'medium' to various kinds of communication, including transportation, the press, film, radio, and even language. In the 1920s these usages are specific and illustrate clear differences of meaning; by 1940 the instrumental meaning overshadows the others, as a secondary function attached to a primary denotation. The history of the word not only illumines the history of communication studies but also helps shape this area of study and its practices.},

  abstract = {Roughly two decades after the first issue of the American Political Science Review, sampling theory emerged to encourage learning about the many from the few. Once social scientists had worked out the selection procedures to deal with large and far-flung human populations, the stage was set for the scientific study of citizen behavior in national elections, as initially demonstrated by George Gallup in predicting the 1936 presidential race. This development unleashed a growing torrent of literature, which by now is simply overwhelming. The many high points in this literature could scarcely be listed, much less abstracted, in the brief compass allowed this essay. So I must invoke some severe selection principles in order to proceed.},

  abstract = {For many of the previous 100 years the role of a journalist was to find information, shape it into an accurate story and transmit it as quickly as possible to a mass audience via a mass medium. Today, information is no longer scarce, breaking news is no longer the province of professional journalists, mass media are declining in influence and news is easily personalized. Like many news organizations, journalism education programs are distinctly unprepared to respond to such deeply structural changes in the environment. Preliminary research indicates that the response to date has been primarily to expand technology training and reorient sequence and media emphasis tracks. The present study recommends a realignment of journalism education from an industry-centered model to a community-centered model as one way to re-engage journalism education in a more productive and vital role in the future of journalism. A community-centered focus could provide a way to conceptualize a reconstitution of journalism education to match that taking place in journalism beyond the university. Three examples from current journalism programs illustrate the implications of this analysis and provide an indication of future directions for realignment.},

It argues that the identity of the field of business communication and all variations thereof ought to be determined by the concep tual problematic underlying its intellectual inquiry rather than by its vocabu lary or instructional practices. On this basis, the paper advocates the view that business communication, management communication, and organizational communication are not, as suggested by the three articles, separate disciplines but interdependent areas of study nested within the domain of the mother discipline of communication. The paper concludes by making the plea for a more inclusive editorial policy that adopts an eclectic methodological stance and encourages substantive debates relating to the nature and processes of communication as constituted by the practical milieu of business.},

I examine Hoggart as a literary critic, using examples from his earliest book on Auden to show how the working-class intellectual engages with canonical literature in a 'high' art form and then I consider a range of his writings about literature to show the importance of literary criticism for Hoggart and his love of literature. This is important because love of literature and commitment to a rigorous literary critical method inform all Hoggart's writing on culture. An understanding of his literary criticism is key to appreciating his cultural analysis and can also offer a way forward at a time when the literary may have been abandoned in the quest for the popular.},

The contribution interrogates this labor/play dialectic while looking at recent literature on games being produced within the current capitalist and neoliberal system, focusing on phenomena like '' playbour'' and on key elements discussed in these theories, from the affordances and limitations of technology to the immaterial technological tools used by gamers and game makers. The article argues that looking at Caillois in relation to Marxism would provide an interesting critical perspective, one that has been underexplored by current approaches. The authors note that contemporary concerns on capitalism and games are far from being at odds with Caillois' distinction between labur and play and suggest that the influence of Marxism on Caillois' writings would provide an interesting terrain of further discussion.},

It starts with where I entered the evolution of the idea as one of his students, points out a problem that emerged as a consequence of generalising information measures from simple to complex systems, i.e. systems with many variables, shows how this problem was eventually solved, and ends with how his idea of decomposing complex systems into smaller interactions reappears in one of the most complex technologies of our time: cyberspace. While nobody could anticipate the complexities that developed since, Ashby's idea of understanding complex systems in terms of manageable interactions, which I call electronic artefacts, is actually practised today and cyberspace is again worth analysing in information theoretical terms.},

Mass communication served as a focus for larger anxieties about social order, social evolution, the future of American democracy, and the integrity of the public sphere. The theoretical grapplings of these thinkers with the symbolic mediation of society, however inadequate they are, show us that the relation between society and its self-representations is a problem for modern society generally, not only for the putatively '' postmodern''; climate of the late twentieth century.},

@book{simpson_science_1994,
  abstract = {In this provocative study, Christopher Simpson demonstrates how the government-funded psychological warfare programs of the Cold War years underwrote the academic studies that formed the basis for much of modern communication research. U.S. psychological warfare programs in the Philippines, Middle East and Southeast Asia became essential in the creation and survival of what is widely considered to be mainstream mass communication studies. They aided in forming the widely held preconceptions that persist today in communication studies, public opinion research, and in the types of counterinsurgency operations that are today known as "public diplomacy" and "low intensity conflict.". Science of Coercion: Communication Research and Psychological Warfare, 1945-1960 provides the first thorough examination of the role of the CIA, Pentagon, and other U.S. security agencies in the evolution of modern communication studies. Christopher Simpson contends that it is unlikely that communication research could have emerged in its present form without regular transfusions of money from U.S. military, intelligence, and propaganda agencies during the Cold War. These agencies saw mass communication as an instrument for persuading or dominating targeted groups in the United States and abroad; as a tool for improving military operations; and perhaps most fundamentally, as a means to extend U.S. influence more widely than ever before at a relatively modest cost. Communication research, in turn, became for a time the preferred method for testing and developing such techniques . Science of Coercion outlines the history of U.S. psychological warfare between 1945 and 1960, discussing the underlying theories, activities, and administrative structure of this type of communication enterprise. In the process, Simpson documents the role played by prominent mass communication researchers including Wilbur Schramm, Ithiel de Sola Pool, Samuel Stouffer, and Paul Lazarsfield to demonstrate the links between the so-called "founding fathers" of communication studies in the United States and psychological warfare programs. Drawing on long-classified documents and extensive archival research, Simpson has produced a fascinating study in the history of science and the sociology of knowledge. Science of Coercion offers valuable insights into the dynamics of ideology and the social psychology of mass communication. It will provide informative reading for scholars and students of communication, the history of science, and social psychology, as well as the general reader.},

An example of this is philosopher Benedict of Spinoza's ideas on the power of images and the importance of emotions to explain human behavior. This article delves into how Spinoza's ideas have been transmitted to classic public relations authors such as Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays through the works of their masters and their mentors: George Santayana, who was one of Lippmann's philosophy professors at Harvard, and Sigmund Freud, an uncle of Bernays whose psychoanalysis theory shaped Bernays' approach to persuasion. In contrast to these public relations masters of persuasion who had a pessimistic view of the human condition, Spinoza's Ethics is based on a positive anthropology of man that squares well with contemporary and more ethical relationship-building approaches to public relations.},

@phdthesis{flayhan_marxism_1997,
  abstract = {This dissertation is an intellectual history and critical analysis of medium theory investigations of communication technologies. The more common approaches to viewing technology as savior or slayer are a consequence of the technological sublime in our time of technological saturation. It is argued that the way to break out of this technological sublime-induced grand dichotomy is to follow the lead of medium theorists who investigate the unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture, and to follow the lead of marxists who place technological developments within the larger dynamic of a system based on the drive for profit. Intellectual influences and theoretical implications of the work of prominent scholars such as Harold Adams Innis, Herbert Marshall McLuhan, Joshua Meyrowitz, James Carey, Walter Ong, and Neil Postman are analyzed throughout the dissertation. The main contribution of medium theorists has been their ability to analyze the impact of unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture; their collective weakness has been a tendency to slight important social factors such as the drive for profit, inequality, and class. To correct this problem, it is argued that medium theory should be merged with an activist marxist tradition. A synthesis of activist marxism and medium theory, it is argued, will give to marxist scholars a better sense of unintended consequences and to medium theorists a better sense of the drive for profit, inequality, and class. Finally, it is argued that scholarship in general, and marxist/medium theory scholarship in particular, is most fruitful when scholars are actively aware of, and engaged in, significant struggles of the day. Just as activist marxists argue for theoretically informed activism, scholarship would benefit from activist informed theory. It is at the point of praxis, theory informed action and action informed theory, that thought and action converge to enhance understanding of our world and to make the world a better place.},

  abstract = {The concept of mass goes back a long way to characterize a society that consists of people somehow connected by communication while, at the same time, also dispersed in space and essentially detached from one another. Mass has also been a pejorative for critics of modern capitalist society and its culture. In the years after World War II, this latter use of the term became the target of a broadside attack by several highly credentialed scholars, who questioned its value as an analytic tool. This paper, starting with Ferdinand T{\"o}nnies, offers a brief overview of both the origins of the concept of mass and its subsequent refinement by French, German, and American sociologists into the mid-1930s. Distinguishing between its ideological connotations and the analytic use of the term helps us to focus on the most general and persistent effects of mass communication: expanding the range of common experience and making people more responsive to distant events. This effect is magnified by the ubiquity of mass media; practically no one, not even those who scorn them, can altogether escape their influence.},

This paper puzzles over the lack of reference \textendash{} by McLuhan, his mentors, and his critics \textendash{} to an earlier group of British thinkers (from Shaftesbury to Adam Smith) who deliberated over the differences among the arts. Their treatises on how the mind processes visual and auditory information remarkably foreshadow McLuhan's assertion that the media constrain how we think and feel. Present-day debate over the effects of new media technology, as well as current theories of reception, reflect McLuhan's stimulating (though exasperating) insights. His footprints also point to cognitive science and, of course, to globalism.},

  abstract = {Media and communication studies have always been international. Still, in the era of globalization, internationalistic agendas have to be radicalized, opened up also to non-Western media thought, setting out from existing regional modernities and transformations. Thus, globalization calls for regional, not universalistic epistemologies and for cross-disciplinary, not intra-disciplinary research efforts. The chapter develops these arguments, first by recapitulating the criticism of the media and development paradigm \textendash{} an early theory of media and social change. This is followed up by a summary report on media and global inequalities in the post-Cold War period, suggesting that the relations between media, politics and economy develop contrary to the prescriptions of received models. This leads to a reinforced questioning of the very distinctions between, e.g., politics, economy and culture in media studies, as illustrated by examples from case studies of recent developments in new democracies and (neo)authoritarian systems.},

  abstract = {Research on media and mass communication has been in a state of constant flux for some 50 years. Scholars in the Humanities have traditionally studied the meaning of human expression in language, philosophy, the Arts and literature. Social scientists have focused on the relations between media institutions and other institutions, not least political ones. With the so-called 'cultural turn' in the 1980s, media scholars' interest shifted to the role of media in the development of culture, on the potential of media to generate meaning in a broader sense, and on the adaptation of media messages to culturally dominant forms of understanding. Today, the field is characterized by extreme diversity and extensive specialization. Studies on the systems level are few. At the same time, contemporary multicultural and global societies raise more complex issues than ever before. Given the high degree of specialization, scholars in the field may not be exposed to the impulses needed for them to be able to formulate incisive research problems. For the discipline to produce new insights and new knowledge requires collaboration - within the discipline, but above all collaboration across academic as well as national frontiers},

  abstract = {Fred Casmir's third culture building (TCB) framework made a major theoretical contribution to communication studies. Casmir conceptualized the framework as an active process whereby different cultural groups come together to form a third culture between them. The third culture then becomes a common ground for all participants; a cognitive space that incorporates elements of both cultures and yet remains separate and distinct. Third culture building is a departure from adoption (the process of taking on the cultural mores of another) or adaptation (modifying one's cultural mores to better fit those of another), and achieved through deliberate development in an extended process, during which all participants gain an understanding of, and appreciation for, one another. In this essay, the authors review the life and work of Fred Casmir \textendash{} a leading figure in establishing intercultural communication as a specific area of study. Next the authors discuss the ideological foundations, intended use, key applications and heuristic value of Casmir's third culture building framework.},

  abstract = {While having a solid foundation in philosophy, Walter J. Ong did not identify with any philosophical school or movement, preferring to interpret philosophy simply as love of wisdom, which is best pursued not by logic and treatise, but by rhetoric and conversation. Beginning during his formative years at Saint Louis University in the 1940s, he integrated metaphysics and communication, suggesting that the focus of philosophy should be not on the idea but on being. It is within these perspectives that Ong probed issues that later became identified with media ecology. Thomism provided a '' furniture of mind'' to weigh post-Hegelian dialectic and to probe the implications of existentialistic dialogue (Jaspers, Camus-Sartre, Marcel); to phenomenologically explore personalist interiority and encounter (Lavelle, Buber, Hopkins); to interpret human thought within the context of cosmic time and evolution (Teilhard); to consider speech philosophy as an alternative to Ramist and Cartesian methodology (Rosenstock-Huessy); and to promulgate an oral hermeneutic that contextualizes concept within being (Bakhtin, Rosenstock-Huessy). The argument of this essay is supported by substantial quotation of previously unpublished materials from the Walter J. Ong archival collection at Saint Louis University.},

A total of 131 articles were coded for general information about journals, primary topic/context of the study, use of theories or models, research methods, units of analysis/types of sample, and countries or locations. Findings showed that the number of mobile communication-related studies increased over the time period of interest. Scholars examined uses and users' characteristics of mobile communication as well as the effects of mobile media on everyday life. Most studies used quantitative methods such as survey of the general population. Theories or theoretical models were not frequently used in mobile communication research. Regarding the usage of theories or theoretical models, about half of mobile communication studies (48.1\%) used theories and/or models as theoretical frameworks. Implications for improving this field of research are specifically discussed.},

These periodic outbursts of disquiet can be best understood as panics about the potential impact of the media on public morality. Such reactions were not simply media panics but panics about the effects of the media. The focus of anxiety was not on any particular issue but on the threat to moral authority posed by the media on the outlook and behaviour of the public. By its very existence the media appeared to represent a potential threat to the moral order. Exploring the moral dimension of this reaction is essential for the study of moral panics.},

The main argument is that what has been frequently ignored is the supranational dimension of the term European'. Thus, while the field of European film studies has witnessed a number of significant shifts in emphasis (most pertinently the refocusing from art cinema towards popular film genres), the core debate still primarily centres on national cinemas. The article then suggests engaging in areas that exemplify interconnectedness between national cinemas. These include patterns of inter-European migration and issues of multiculturalism; industrial practices such as co-productions; as well as localized strategies of receiving foreign films through mechanisms of translation and adaptation.},

His book, The Silent Language, published in 1959 and generally listed as the first work in the field, has been influential in setting the agenda for the field of intercultural communication. At the same time, it is important to understand that Hall's work was not invented de novo, but rested heavily upon work begun with a series of colleagues for the specific purpose of training American diplomats about to be sent abroad. Understanding The Silent Language and the effect it has had on the study of intercultural communication requires knowing about the history of a particular group of linguists and anthropologists at a particular place, the Foreign Service Institute, and time, 1946\textendash{}1956; that history is the focus here.},

It spurred an entire literature of academic research both about \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} and the idea of technology assessment more generally. Understanding the legislative history and implementation of the Technology Assessment Act is crucial not just for scholarship, though. \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} was a blueprint for institutionalizing politically accountable technology assessment. Even as technologies advance at rapid rates, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} still offers valuable lessons that scholars and policy-makers alike ought to glean. This paper places \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} in a contemporary context of (institutionalized) technology assessment. It contributes to a better understanding of OTA's origins by tracing its lineage to a set of federal reports beginning in 1929. It then analyzes OTA's response to pragmatic implementation questions of how to strike a balance between speed, depth, scope, and temporal focus. Lastly, it uses a public values framework to critique OTA's failure to adequately incorporate participatory elements into its processes.},

  abstract = {The focus of the article is on the author's experience as learner and teacher. The task of preparing law students for their professional life is compared to that of teaching undergraduates who, in the uniquely strenuous College of the University of Chicago, are interested in books and ideas and are not im\- mediately job-driven. Whereas in the law school setting the author, like other law professors, worked alone, in the College he worked with a staff of colleagues who shared in the choice of readings and in lectures to the entire student body-altogether, in the author's view, a more demanding task for the teacher. Graduate education in sociology is again different: the student is an apprentice professional, but there is no clear road toward professional prac\- tice; the faculty member as mentor on the disse:rtation helps pilot the appren\- tice through the cross-currents of conflict in the field and in the particular department. Teaching undergraduates in Harvard College, the author reports, involved tasks different from those faced in the College of the University of Chicago. Rather than working, as at Chicago, with a staff of presumptive equals, at Harvard the author recruited advanced graduate students and junior (and on occasion, senior) faculty whom he treated as colleagues, but whom Harvard undergraduates tended to deprecate as mere "section men," i.e. teaching assistants. The author details efforts to overcome what was 30 years ago the fabled yet quite real pose of "Harvard indifference"-a lack of engagement with subject matter and with noncelebrity faculty. The Harvard colleague group worked to get students to do small pieces of fieldwork, not merely as exercises, but out of interest in a topic and an idea. When with the rise of a radical student-faculty "movement" many undergraduates became less "cool," the problems of teaching subtly changed. Always, the author notes, teaching is contextual and often needs to work against the prevailing tide.},

@article{korzi_lapsed_2000,
  abstract = {With the rise of the democratic state came a strong emphasis on "the public" or "public opinion" in the study of politics. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of important works examined the contours of public opinion within a democracy. The study of public opinion since this early period has only intensified. However, recent work on public opinion is problematic: the theoretical and normative concerns and the political / sociological focus of the early works on public opinion are largely missing. Most modern studies of public opinion are psychologically driven and often truncated from broad concerns of American politics and democratic theory. In this article, I explicate the history of public opinion research, paying particular attention to the "early" works and how their concerns and emphases have been neglected by many "later" studies of public opinion. Through this history I aim to highlight the differences between the early and later phases and to suggest that much was lost in neglecting the concerns of the early writers on public opinion. While some contemporary researchers are, in fact, harking back to the early work, I conclude that a more thorough re-acquaintance with the classics of public opinion is necessary.},

Moreover, his concept of 'reinforcement' is a major link to the central argument of critical theory that the media reinforce the status quo.

  abstract = {Moving world-systems analysis into the cultural realm, Richard E. Lee locates the cultural studies movement within a broad historical and geopolitical framework. He illuminates how order and conflict have been reflected and negotiated in the sphere of knowledge production by situating the emergence of cultural studies at the intersection of post\textendash{}1945 international and British politics and a two-hundred-year history of conservative critical practice. Tracing British criticism from the period of the French Revolution through the 1960s, he describes how cultural studies in its infancy recombined the elite literary critical tradition with the First New Left's concerns for history and popular culture\textemdash{}just as the liberal consensus began to come apart. Lee tracks the intellectual project of cultural studies as it developed over three decades, beginning with its institutional foundation at the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS). He links work at the CCCS to the events of 1968 and explores cultural studies' engagement with theory in the debates on structuralism. He considers the shift within the discipline away from issues of working-class culture toward questions of identity politics in the fields of race and gender. He follows the expansion of the cultural studies project from Britain to Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. Contextualizing the development and spread of cultural studies within the longue dur{\'e}e structures of knowledge in the modern world-system, Lee assesses its past and future as an agent of political and social change.},

  abstract = {Despite his intellectual impact in the field of communication studies during the 1970s, Ludovico Silva is hardly remembered today even in his native country, Venezuela. Showing a singular intellectual honesty, Ludovico Silva worked on a general theory of ideology, challenging the official Marxism and leftist political forces of the age. Based on Marx\textasciiacute{}s difference between use value and exchange value, Silva argued that the Marxist category of surplus needed an equivalent in the symbolic realm; hence he developed the concept of ideological surplus in order to reject mechanical interpretations of ideology. Thus, Silva, among other scholars, contributed to Latin American communication studies by incorporating power and domination as structural forces in the making of social relations. The ideological power of media became the ultimate concern in media studies, questioning the explanatory value of the functionalist and quantitative studies focused on media effects, which were dominant at that time. Silva\textasciiacute{}s work is recovered here in a historical perspective, stressing his intellectual commitment to the truth, and his contribution to move Latin American communication studies from a conventional academic stance to a critical one.},

  abstract = {In a time in which an exuberant, trans-classical, non-trivial machine culture redesigns terminologies, remodels logics, produces new evidence, and reorganizes semantic resources, a new, neocybernetic regime of truth is taking shape. Many of our recent self-descriptions and theory formations are coined by our media-technological condition. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of Niklas Luhmann, especially in his inherent narrative of the history of rationality. This essay attempts to reconstruct Luhmann's redescription of European rationality, especially the media- and machine-historical conditions that remain apparent in Luhmann's account. The decisive issue is that Luhmann's history of rationality reveals the technological unconscious of systems theory and indeed the epochal imaginary it belongs to. With the help of the theories of machines developed by von Foerster, Simondon and G{\"u}nther, Luhmann's oeuvre must be read as probably the most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what could be called the 20th-century's epochal technological shift of meaning.},

George Gallup's polling techniques first achieved fame when he accurately predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would be reelected president in 1936. Gallup had devised an extremely effective sampling method that took households from all income brackets into account, and Hollywood studio executives quickly pounced on the value of Gallup's research. Soon he was gauging reactions to stars and scripts for RKO Pictures, David O. Selznick, and Walt Disney and taking the public's temperature on Orson Welles and Desi Arnaz, couples such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and films like Gone with the Wind, Dumbo, and Fantasia. Through interviews and extensive research, Susan Ohmer traces Gallup's groundbreaking intellectual and methodological developments, examining his comprehensive approach to market research from his early education in the advertising industry to his later work in Hollywood. The results of his opinion polls offer a fascinating glimpse at the class and gender differences of the time as well as popular sentiment toward social and political issues.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the abundance of Greek figures and scenarios in Kittler's recent work points to a shift in his oeuvre, which, however, does not represent a radical break with his 'hardware studies'. At the turn of the 21st century, Kittler champions an emphatic notion of culture as a necessary supplement to science and technology. This conceptual marriage mediates grand historical narratives of cultural identity. Specifically, Kittler's texts provide us with narratives of Greek origin which serve to re-capture collective identities in the age of globalization. On the explicit level, this identity is predominantly European, but the search has national components as well. With his turn to culture, the organizing trope of 19th-century German nationalism, Kittler has also embraced the legacy of German philhellenism, which articulated national identities through the theme of 'elective affinity'. Kittler's Greece occupies the very structural place it had in 19th-century German philhellenism: It stands in for both the foundation of European civilization and its virtual better self, a realm of sensual culture untainted by modern capitalism and Empire. Most of the figures inhabiting this realm are familiar from 19th-century discourse as well, but these discursive loops are fueled by contemporary feedback. Kittler's Greek narratives have developed out of postwar academic discourses and connect to other post-unification Greek fantasies.},

Statistical data can mislead, however, when numbers are reported without careful attention to the shifting classification schemes that underlie them. The work that is needed in order to understand the recent emergence of a communication discipline is at least as much theoretical and interpretive as it is empirical. To illustrate this point, we explore two types of indicators of growth and transformation of communication studies: statistics on degrees granted and trends in the classification of books and serials. For each type of indicator we show that the emergence of communication as a category has involved qualitative transformation of the category itself as well as quantitative growth within the category. This categorical transformation, and its deeper roots in the evolution of communication as a cultural practice, will be basic to any adequate interpretation of our discipline's increasing centrality in academe and in society.},

Both investigations were affiliated to the Princeton-Columbia workshop; both were connected with P. F. Lazarsfeld's personality; both showed the influence of radio broadcasting to be socially differentiated and conditioned; both researches were joined with the war, which interfered in them as a factor of motivation; both used ''focused interviews'' and similar procedures and verified their results by surveys; both projects belonged to the class of ''Firehouse Research'' demanding, contrary to expectations, collection of data immediately after the event. The paper acquaints readers with the questions, methods and results of both investigations. It shows and emphasises the combined use of different methods with the unique intent of problem-understanding and positively evaluates the look to the workshop, which both publications offer.},

It argues that, notwithstanding postwar trends that have significantly changed adolescence, the family home, and wider consumer society, there was time for the 1950s family experiment to spawn the 1960s and 1970s family television experiment, thereby shaping normative expectations\textendash{}academic, policy, and popular\textendash{}regarding television audiences for years to come. At the turn of the twenty-first century, we must recognize that it was the underlying long-term trend of individualization, and its associated trends of consumerism, globalization, and democratization, that, historically and now, more profoundly frame the place of television in the family.},

  abstract = {The article presents an interview of Hans Ziesel, professor of law and sociology at the University of Chicago Law School. Answering to a question on the present condition of advertising research Ziesel said that, now research has spread enormously in many ways it has shifted from the agency and the media to the manufacturers. The agencies concentrate more and more on what is called creative research following the bifurcation that began with idea of separating the creative work from the bulk of administrative and mechanical work. He thinks research has followed it. The shift away from the agencies was facilitated by a perennial headache namely, the problem of billing research from the agency. Every so often the agency had to absorb these costs, so the development was really by mutual agreement, toward the manufacturer taking charge of his own research. On asking Ziesel about the legal side of his activities, Ziesel said that his work during the last 20 years at the University of Chicago Law School, was making lawyers aware that there is more to law than only study, constitutions, court decisions, and statutes.},

  abstract = {Increasingly, International Relations (IR) theorists are drawing inspiration from a broad range of theorists outside the discipline. One thinks of the introduction of Antonio Gramsci's writings to IR theorists by Robert Cox, for example, and the 'school' that has developed in its wake. Similarly, the works of Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, and Jurgen Habermas are all relatively familiar to most IR theorists not because of their writings on world politics per se, but because they were imported into the field by roving theorists. Many others of varying success could be cited as well. Such cross-disciplinary excursions are important because they inject vitality into a field that \textendash{} in the opinion of some at least\textemdash{}is in need of rejuvenation in the face of contemporary changes. In this paper, I elaborate on the work of the Canadian communications theorist Harold Innis, situating his work within contemporary IR theory while underlining his historicism, holism, and attention to time-space biases.},

  abstract = {What is metal studies? How can we define and characterize it? How has it emerged as a body of academic enquiry? What are its dominant disciplinary strands, theoretical concepts and preferred methodologies? Which studies have claimed most attention, defined the goals of scholarship, typical research strategies and values? How has the claim for the legitimacy or symbolic value of metal scholarship been achieved (if it has): over time and through gradual acceptance or through conflict and contestation? How can this process of formation, or strategy of legitimation, be mapped, examined and interrogated and which methods of historical, institutional and cultural analysis are best suited to this task? Working with the most complete bibliography to date of published research on heavy metal, music and culture (the MSBD), this article employs Foucault's archaeological "method" to examine the institutional, cultural and political contexts and conflicts that inform the genealogy of this scholarship. Such analysis reveals a formative, largely negative account of heavy metal to be found in the "sociology of rock"; a large volume of psychology work, examining heavy metal music preference as an indicator of youth risk, deviance and delinquency; sociological work on youth and deviancy critical of the values of this research and its links to social policy and politics; culminating in the work of Weinstein and Walser, who advocate a perspective sympathetic to the values of heavy metal fans themselves. Following Bourdieu, I interpret such symbolic strategies as claims for expertise within the academic field that are high or low in symbolic capital to the extent they can attain disciplinary autonomy. I then go on to examine the most recent strands of research, within cultural studies and ethnomusicology, concerned with the global metal music diaspora, and consider to what extent such work is constitutive of a coherent subfield of metal studies that can be distinguished from earlier work and what the implications of this might be.},

On asking about his definition of a good marketing person he said that, a guy that really knows how to utilize information to make a buck, and somehow to build a franchise or make products better. A marketing guy really is a guy who basically would like to have his own business and, all too often because circumstances are such, cannot have it. And it seems to him that the big contribution that marketing research people make is to be marketing guides to people who have marketing jobs. Answering to a question about his advise to a young person who was just entering the research field he said that the first thing the person should do is to go out and do door-to-door interviewing. Let somebody give him a practical problem and then go out and try to build his own questionnaire.},

The first concerns 'transdisciplinarity', a new context for cultural studies, created by the 'cultural turn' in humanities and social sciences more generally. The second addresses the need to distinguish history as a discipline from a wider range of approaches that grasp the 'historicity' or 'temporality' of human life. The work of the hermeneutic philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, helps to identify this difference and engages with the double character of historical work: part empirical study, part 'fiction'. The article itself can be read as a narrative about history and cultural studies \textendash{} a story of debts and differences, polemics and splits, convergences and renewed dialogue. The article urges us to recognize the implications for historical cultural studies of moves towards 'culturality' in history.},

The article points to the sophistication of research and writing prior to 1960, in popular and more scholarly focused work. It argues that the historiography of this topic should be understood in terms of longer processes of development and institutional constraints which correlate with similar developments in other areas of historical research.},

@book{woodhams_history_2001,
  abstract = {For a generation of political activists growing up in the 1930's opposing Fascism was a priority. The policy of appeasing Hitler and the non-partisan stance of the Labour Party in the face of the Spanish Civil War made the Communist Party an attractive alternative. From this generation emerged key figures in academia and publishing: Eric Hobsbawm, Ralph Miliband, John Saville, Martin Eve, Dorothy and Edward Thompson, and Raymond Williams. Woodhams studies the experiences of this generation, the motives which attracted them towards the CPGB, and their reactions to and experiences in the Second World War. He examines what opportunities were open to them in the post-war years and their influence particularly in the field of adult education. He argues that Raymond Williams anticipated some of the thinking of the new left, especially in the field of cultural studies. But in the shadow of the1956 events in Hungary another new left emerged drawing on post-war experiences and circumstances. This collective biography throws a new light on the continuities and breaks in British political and intellectual history. It challenges conventional periodization separating pre- and post-war history and questions the sources of continuity and change in Britain.},

  abstract = {From its beginning, American journalism has been anchored in both the printing trades and the world of intellectuals who recognized the value of newspapers in shaping public opinion. These dual origins influenced the debate over journalism education from the mid-nineteenth century. News professionals and university educators pondered whether journalists needed to be college-educated, whether they needed a liberal arts degree, or whether they needed professional education that combined liberal arts and practical training. These debates were complex and political, representing issues of localism versus nationalism, the role of professional schools within the American university, and the rise of social science. The tension between educating reporters and editors to improve the quality of journalism or contribute to a democracy versus training them to function efficiently in a newspaper office\textemdash{}or any media environment\textemdash{}continues today.},

  abstract = {Through surveying the literature on Mexican mass media published in American academic journals and books from 1945 to 1994, and the published literature in Mexico by Mexican researchers during the same period, this thesis assesses the influence of U.S. mass communication research ideologies and posits that Western scholars, mostly Americans, approach the study of Mexican mass media according to Western social, political, and cultural values. In general, traditional American social science methodologies, in particular, mass communication research, dominate Mexican mass media studies. Specifically, American scholars have tended to direct their analysis to the free expression of newspapers. This study found that most Americans in this field have limited themselves to judging the entirety of Mexican mass media from an American cultural viewpoint. In support of this conclusion, critical researchers have linked the problem of exporting 'alien' methods of study to Mexico and of bypassing or ignoring the social, cultural, and political realities of Mexico and other Latin American countries. This thesis shows how traditional American international media research conceives the Mexican media system from an American cultural perspective, thereby introducing a conceptualization of culture that implies the context of a free market of ideas in a free market economy. Still, based on a Cultural studies perspective, as posited by Stuart Hall and others, this study shows that by framing research questions based on Mexico's social, economic, and political realities (for instance, a dependent, capitalist society as opposed to an advanced, capitalist one), ethnocentric biases are avoided. The main question this thesis studies is: What approach have American scholars taken in their analysis of Mexican mass media? Findings of the research confirm the common complaint that the bulk of research carried out by American mass media scholars on Latin America has lacked sensitivity toward its cultural values, political systems, and economic conditions. Similarly, this study found that much of the media research in Mexico carried out by Mexican scholars followed lines of inquiry, theories, and methodologies proposed by Western researchers. Finally, this research shows that lack of indigenous research accounts for the theoretical dependency of Mexican scholarly works.},

@book{horowitz_consuming_2012,
  abstract = {How is it that American intellectuals, who had for 150 years worried about the deleterious effects of affluence, more recently began to emphasize pleasure, playfulness, and symbolic exchange as the essence of a vibrant consumer culture? The New York intellectuals of the 1930s rejected any serious or analytical discussion, let alone appreciation, of popular culture, which they viewed as morally questionable. Beginning in the 1950s, however, new perspectives emerged outside and within the United States that challenged this dominant thinking. Consuming Pleasures reveals how a group of writers shifted attention from condemnation to critical appreciation, critiqued cultural hierarchies and moralistic approaches, and explored the symbolic processes by which individuals and groups communicate. Historian Daniel Horowitz traces the emergence of these new perspectives through a series of intellectual biographies. With writers and readers from the United States at the center, the story begins in Western Europe in the early 1950s and ends in the early 1970s, when American intellectuals increasingly appreciated the rich inventiveness of popular culture. Drawing on sources both familiar and newly discovered, this transnational intellectual history plays familiar works off each other in fresh ways. Among those whose work is featured are J{\"u}rgen Habermas, Roland Barthes, Umberto Eco, Walter Benjamin, C. L. R. James, David Riesman and Marshall McLuhan, Richard Hoggart, members of London's Independent Group, Stuart Hall, Paddy Whannel, Tom Wolfe, Herbert Gans, Susan Sontag, Reyner Banham, and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.},

However, the Journal focused most of its critical energies on what were known at the time as groundlevel comics, small, independently published comics that utilised the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror and superheroes. The Journal largely ignored alternative comics until the late 1980s, and it wasn't until the 1990s that the Journal fully embraced them as the driving force for the evolution and improvement of American comics.},

Tracing its development from beginnings in postwar Britain, through its various transformations in the 1960s and 1970s, to the emergence of British cultural studies at Birmingham, and up to the advent of Thatcherism, Dworkin shows this history to reflect a coherent intellectual tradition, one that represents an implicit and explicit theoretical effort to resolve the crisis of the postwar British Left. Limited to neither a single discipline nor a particular intellectual figure, this book comprehensively views British cultural Marxism in terms of the dialogue between historians and the originators of cultural studies and in its relationship to the new left and feminist movements. From the contributions of Eric Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, Sheila Rowbotham, Rodney Hilton, Catherine Hall, and E. P. Thompson to those of Perry Anderson, Barbara Taylor, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, and Dick Hebdidge, Dworkin examines the debates over issues of culture and society, structure and agency, experience and ideology, and theory and practice. The rise, demise, and reorganization of journals such as The Reasoner, The New Reasoner, Universities and Left Review, New Left Review, Past and Present are also part of the history told in this volume. In every instance, the focus of Dworkin's attention is the intellectual work seen in its political context. Capturing the excitement and commitment that more than one generation of historians, literary critics, art historians, philosophers, and cultural theorists have felt about an unorthodox and critical tradition ofMarxist theory, Cultural Marxism in Postwar Britain will appeal to students and scholars of cultural studies as well as those interested in the broader terrain of Marxist theory and contemporary critical theory.},

  abstract = {The heyday of classical film theory is predominantly understood to have been concerned with ontological and formal matters and with promoting film as an art. Pursuing the shapes and contours of the new medium, many writers on cinema from the 1920s heralded cinema as a 'universal language'. Examining the 'universal language' thesis, one finds a remarkable variety to the various arguments. By undertaking a close prospect of just one version of the 'universal language' thesis by a single writer, B{\'e}la Bal{\'a}zs, this essay intends to complicate the enterprise of 1920s 'classical film theory'. Tracing back the messy trail of reception and production and returning to the heart of Bal{\'a}zs's output, one finds a universal language which is neither truly universal, nor technically a language. Bal{\'a}zs's writings on cinema and language form the basis of a Janus-faced philosophy caught between future and past, film theory and human history, between an anthropology of the person and a prescription for various peoples. Re-examining Bal{\'a}zs and interrogating the 'universal language thesis' draws attention to the various modes, functions and addressees of what is called 'classical film theory' and to the need for new historiographical paradigms which take material matters of production and reception into account. At the same time, Bal{\'a}zs serves as an example for what unites many of the 1920s classical film theorists: the tension between the universal and the nationally specific and between their proposed theories and implied histories of film.},

The main focus is to identify the emergence of this field, its position in relation to other academic disciplines, and its objects of study, mainly the reception studies. Although there are features of Latin American cultural studies that are unique to this region, the author concludes that the present situation reveals that Latin American cultural studies is tied to the broad current movement of this field of study.},

In this essay, the work of two prominent communication and media studies scholars, Joshua Meyrowitz and James Carey, is examined in order to demonstrate how their studies represent media ecology with rigorous and insightful analyses of the dynamic interaction between communication, consciousness, and culture. Perhaps more importantly, this essay highlights how the works of these two media ecologists fit into and embody a North American cultural studies approach to media studies. The intent of this essay is to push the understanding of the intellectual roots of media ecology toward a broader analysis of how media ecology is embedded in, and advocates for, the larger move in communication studies away from narrow, quantitative effects research and towards qualitative and interdisciplinary scholarship that is North American cultural studies.},

With a full-blown academic legitimation crisis well under way, cultural studies resonated strongly with social struggles that shaped both its reception as well as its capacity to augment new intellectual academic formations. Retrieving the historical nexus questions views that treat and limit British cultural studies to being mainly an intellectual import-export phenomenon. The overlooked historical nexus fosters trivialization anad caricature of cultural studies' incorporation in the American academia, resulting in both conservative antipathy and left disappointments feeding into the common binary narratives of the 'failure' of cultural studies for being too Marxist and not Marxist enough.

  abstract = {This paper will focus on an applied research initiative we are currently engaged in, which brings together academics (both from conventional institutions \textendash{} the university, the research centers and undergraduate colleges \textendash{} and from 'new and innovative institutional structures') with policy-makers and grant-making organizations. The initiative has to do with the entire field of higher education (India having one of the biggest higher education systems in the world), but interestingly it was incubated by the Center for the Study of Culture and Society (CSCS). The painstaking process of the gestation of collaborative interdisciplinary themes/fields of research/teaching and the labor of negotiation with policy-makers and grantees in the field of higher education by a Cultural Studies centre is thus the focus of this paper. Called the Higher Education Cell, an important aspect of the initiative's genealogy is that it is based on (a) a critique of the existing disciplines and an attention to the birthing of 'new thematic/field specifics' as also (b) a critique of the research undertaken in mainstream institutions and an attention to new research methodologies. The Higher Education Cell is at present focusing on four major functions through which it plans to engage with the higher education sector. These functions are (i) Incubation of Research Initiatives, (ii) Institutional Collaborations, (iii) Documentation and Archiving, and (iv) Grant Development. The research initiatives, which include Globalization and Higher Education, General Education in Comparative Perspective, Regional Language Resources, and Social Justice in Higher Education, have been conceived through collaborations with a range of higher education institutions. The wider context of the labor of negotiation is one where (1) new institutional structures are being experimented with, resulting in the emergence of 'institutions with a difference', (2) new interdisciplinary courseware or new themes/fields of research/teaching are being created (such as film-media studies, gender-sexuality-Dalit studies, migration studies, environment studies) and (3) new research and pedagogic methodologies are being given shape.},

  abstract = {This article presents an always risky cartography of the institutionalization of the field of Cultural Studies in Colombia in the 1990s. The article starts with a personal narration on how the author was introduced to this novel field by entering the first graduate programme in Cultural Studies in Colombia. Here, it locates the major tensions, stereotypes and loud silences characteristic of the social sciences in Colombia in which this institutionalization was infused and also threatened by the 1990s. But far from thinking that this recent event inaugurated an intellectual project thanks to the importation of theories and methodologies at this moment, the article describes previous intellectual traditions like the one influenced by the works of Orlando Fals Borda that had challenged positivist and neutral intellectual approaches to major problems in Colombia. Also, it highlights the influence that the work of Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero had through his paramount work on media and mediation since the 1970s. Afterwards, the article succinctly contextualizes the institutionalization of Cultural Studies in the 1990s through the emergence of the Ministry of Culture and the multicultural mantra and a whole scholarly and state's concern for cultural industries and culture policies. Finally, it describes the ?perverse confluences? between these new events and the arrival of neoliberal policies that had radically changed and challenged Colombian public and private universities. The article concludes with a contrasting image between a multiplication of interests, programmes, departments, conferences and publications in Cultural Studies in the larger universities in Colombia and their rampant transformation through the new scripts of audit cultures, indexation and the whole quantification of knowledge production.},

It refers, however,only to the German reception of cultural studies and focuses on the different ways cultural studies have become influential in various contexts since the 1970s. Three major stages can, roughly, be detected. The first comes from a new Leftist background dealing with working class and youth culture, and the discussion of the notion 'ideology'. The second grew out of the youth culture debate in an attempt to re-politicize it, elaborated by the so-called 'German Pop left'. The third is now within academia, particularly in media studies and'Kulturwissenschaften'. The contribution aims to sketch out the limitations of the, however different, lines of the German reception of cultural studies as well as the weaknesses of the attempts to work in cultural studies with reference to what can be called the German (intellectual) tradition.},

  abstract = {The name Cultural Studies and its institutionalization in the university must not allow us to lose sight of the fact that reflection on culture is an old tradition, especially in a society like Peru's, so heterogeneous, conflictive and charged with history. The very fact of the convergence or clash of cultures in the sixteenth century fomented the consciousness that cultural uses and customs are not natural but must be understood in the light of history. Since the seventeenth century we have essays attempting to objectivize cultures and their (mis)understandings. These constitute a tradition of trying to imagine a viable society out of fragmentation. Garcilaso de la Vega and Huam{\'a}n Poma are the founders of this desire to comprehend the other and propose just ways of living together. In the nineteenth century this reflection deepens, since now the task is to constitute a nation. Many will think that homogenization around the creole identity is the path towards modernity. Others will feel that the past lives on and gives form to the present, necessarily complex and plural. This debate about the country takes place in literature and in cultural criticism, in the works of Mari{\'a}tegui, Arguedas, Vargas Llosa, Flores Galindo. This tradition is taken up by Cultural Studies which, as an academic activity is born of the dialogue between the humanities and the social sciences. It is a dialogue in which psychoanalysis functions to facilitate the encounter. This article emphasizes the immediate antecedents of the institutionalization of Cultural Studies and situates them within the framework of a necessary public intervention which characterizes this type of interdisciplinarity.},

Specifically geared towards an Anglophone readership, the paper relates the re-emergence of cultural techniques (a concept first employed in the 19th century in an agricultural context) to the changing intellectual constellation of postwar Germany. More specifically, it traces how the concept evolved from \textendash{} and reacted against \textendash{} so-called German media theory, a decidedly anti-hermeneutic and anti-humanist current of thought frequently associated with the work of Friedrich Kittler. Post-hermeneutic rather than anti-hermeneutic in its outlook, the reconceptualization of cultural techniques aims at presenting them as chains of operations that link humans, things, media and even animals. To investigate cultural techniques is to shift the analytic gaze from ontological distinctions to the ontic operations that gave rise to the former in the first place. As Siegert points out, this shift recalls certain concurrent developments within the North American posthumanities; the paper therefore also includes a discussion of the similarities and differences between German and North American posthumanism.},

  abstract = {This article examines the history of media sociology in the U.S., through a critical analysis of articles published in the major sociology journals during the twentieth century. I argue that media sociology has been at its most vibrant when its goal has been to understand the dominant cultural structures that shape the public sphere. Robert Park was the first sociologist to adopt this perspective, with his research on newspapers and the power of the press. This interest continued into the 1950s, with research on media and propaganda. By the 1960s, however, concern had shifted away from the public character of media, focusing instead on the ways in which social factors intervened between media messages and society. While important, this shift in analytical focus ultimately led to a more reductionist media sociology, which failed to explore how media provided a distinctive type of social output. There is evidence that a less reductionist media sociology has begun to emerge since the 1990s, with the rise of cultural sociology and theories of the public sphere. This new media sociology could increase its visibility within mainstream sociology by making more explicit connections to the Chicago School tradition, and by claiming Robert Park as its classical founder.},

Wright Mills's time at Columbia University's Bureau for Applied Social Research provided a crucial intellectual and institutional basis for his later work, and it uses Mills's career as an allegory for the history and self-understanding of modern-day, self-described '' critical'' scholars. Mills's own published writings, along with those of his biographers, encourage a view of his time at the bureau as an aberration. Yet, a careful examination of his letters and his work reveals that the critical position for which Mills is famous was actually nourished by his use of surveys, statistics, research teams, and other trappings of administrative research while at the bureau.

The aim in generating a multiplicity of origins is not to suggest that the Birmingham origin is 'false' but to underscore the point that cultural studies has multiple origins rather than a singular origin; to provide concrete examples of those other origins that are too seldom suggested and almost never pinpointed; and, most importantly, to contribute to the evolution of a more international cultural studies as well as to keeping cultural studies in progressive, anti-disciplinary flux.},

Today, however, it could be useful to reconsider Berelson's sentence in order to understand what particular field was vanishing. The death sentence pronounced by Berelson, beyond expressing the state of the field of Communication in the 50s, reveals some fundamental questions about Communication research in general; Questions that many have assumed to be resolved but which may be more relevant today than ever.},

As this article demonstrates, these assumptions continue to operate in the literature today. In updating the normative orientations that inform political communication research, the analysis focuses on certain research agendas as exemplar efforts of a changed philosophical position, called neoconservatism, which undergirds and structures studies critical of press performance. In particular, we critically examine 3 research programs in political communication that adhere to the field's formative intellectual assumptions as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis. Suggestions are made for a fuller integration of communication perspectives into political communication research as well as new ways of thinking about media in relation to politics.},

Until the late 1950s, empirical social sciences did not exist in the Soviet Union. Instead of research, society was described by using ideological construction of the Communist Party history. Attitudes toward sociology started to change in the middle of the 1960s. Empirical sociological research expanded into many areas of study and began to spread across the country. Sociology deserved official recognition and was very popular in society; sociologists enjoyed both official and popular prestige.

Because of that, our reasons for disciplinizing?to the extent that it is possible to choose to become a discipline?would be largely strategic.

  abstract = {Mass media campaigns have long been a tool for promoting public health. How effective are such campaigns in changing health-related attitudes and behaviors, however, and how has the literature in this area progressed over the past decade? The purpose of the current article is threefold. First, I discuss the importance of health mass media campaigns and raise the question of whether they are capable of effectively impacting public health. Second, I review the literature and discuss what we have learned about the effectiveness of campaigns over the past 10 years. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of possible avenues for the health campaign literature over the next 10 years. The overriding conclusion is the following: The literature is beginning to amass evidence that targeted, well-executed health mass media campaigns can have small-to-moderate effects not only on health knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, but on behaviors as well, which can translate into major public health impact given the wide reach of mass media. Such impact can only be achieved, however, if principles of effective campaign design are carefully followed.},

  abstract = {One of the central figures in the development of the study of visual communication, Sol Worth (1922-1977) was a filmmaker and painter before he turned to academic pursuits. He began with the question of how film could be understood and studied as medium of communication, and from there, he moved on to larger and more profound questions about the nature of visual media in general and the role that visual images play in shaping and constructing reality. He is perhaps best known for the '' Navajo Film Project'' that he conducted with anthropologist John Adair in which they gave 16mm cameras to Navajo residents of the Pine Springs, Arizona reservation in order to explore how people who had never made or used movies would do so for the first time. How would their movies reflect their own culture and their ways of seeing and telling about their experiences? The book, Through Navajo Eyes, included here, became enormously influential in the fields of anthropology, communication and cinema studies, among others. In The Complete Sol Worth, editors Larry Gross and Jay Ruby collect all of Sol Worth's published writings, as well as some unpublished writings, extensive photo essays, and articles about Worth's work. Sol Worth's work remains relevant and influential in visual communication and anthropology, and the e-book format enables an accessible collection of the entirety of his contributions. Readers can also access Teaterri, a video documentary that Worth produced which is part of a permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. We hope this collection will introduce new readers to Sol Worth's contribution to bettering our understanding of visual communication, culture, and life.One of the central figures in the development of the study of visual communication, Sol Worth (1922-1977) was a filmmaker and painter before he turned to academic pursuits.

Answering to the question on the issues and problems that confronted him when he first entered the research field Nielsen said that, the most serious problem involved the raising of the necessary capital. He had always feared failure due to inadequate capital, and to make sure that this would not be the fate of the new Nielsen Company, he made careful estimates of the amount required and then raised three times that amount. He was aided by members of his fraternity, Sigma Phi, at the University of Wisconsin, who did not really understand the nature of the work the company proposed to undertake, but who had developed confidence in him because they had seen him working day and night to break the records for a scholarship in the College of Engineering\textendash{} records, incidentally, which have not yet been equaled. On asking Nielsen, about his unique contribution in the field he said that, there were several, and they did not all occur at the start. The first was the performance surveys. They were very useful to nearly every client who subscribed to this service. However, it was difficult to persuade the typical client to purchase a sufficient variety of these surveys to enable his salesmen to use them successfully with any type of prospect for his product and so that he could pile proof on proof to an extent which achieved conviction on the part of the prospect.},

He was born in Vienna, Austria and was interested in empirical research because he was trained as a mathematician and partly because empirical social research was of considerable political interest in that time of a rapidly rising Labor party in Austria. He states that in Austria, doing empirical research on the situation of the working class was of very great political importance because it clarified the importance of social stratification. In empirical research, he asserts that one has to distinguish between university organizations, university institutes and the increasing number of commercial research organizations. He claims that the structural elements of a good research bureau have two educational advantages. First, the relation between the project director and his assistant is much more intimate than between a graduate assistant and his graduate student. Second, it forces a much greater clarification of elements involved in research. He claims that there is a simple distinction between the department and the bureau. A full professor cannot tell an assistant professor or even an instructor what to do, that guarantees a famous academic freedom. In a bureau, the director hands to certain staff members certain tasks.},

Until now, accounts about how public opinion research began in Mexico either ignored Radv{\'a}nyi's works or reduced his ten years of survey research to a single footnote.

  abstract = {Scholars exploring the 'problem' of propaganda and democracy, or the history of propaganda and warfare, or the history of American mass communications research, consistently have marked World War I as the point at which the 'idea of propaganda' emerged in the modern era. Historians note that democratic governments had never relied so heavily on elaborate propaganda campaigns as part of their 'total war' ammunition; and never before, it seems, had the democratic citizenry been so manipulated. From the end of the World War I through World War II, a generation of American social critics, political theorists, and government officials were acutely aware that propaganda was ubiquitous, powerful, and a potentially highly destabilizing weapon of political warfare. My study explores the relationship between three important political and intellectual tendencies in mid-twentieth century America: Elite concerns about the rise of 'mass society' and its purported threat to democracy; the growth of American social sciences and the emergence of communications research as a response to the challenges of mass society; and the growth of centralized state power, particularly the state's expanding capacity for marginalizing and controlling political dissent. My dissertation is not a study of the production or dissemination of propaganda, or of different psychological warfare campaigns. Rather, I am concerned with fears about propaganda and how those fears shaped social critics' political assumptions, social scientists' analytical techniques, and government lawyers' frameworks for the purposes of mobilizing for war and creating and enforcing an administrative and prosecutory propaganda 'prophylaxis.' My research and analysis combines traditional concerns of political history with the strategies of intellectual history and the insights of the new cultural studies to explore the contradictions and tensions at the heart of twentieth-century liberal thought and action.},

  abstract = {The main memory of American mass communication research holds that scholars around Paul F. Lazarsfeld, in the years during and after World War II, dispelled the conventional wisdom that media marinate the defenseless American mind. According to the story, a loose and undisciplined body of pre-war thought had concluded naively that media are powerful\textemdash{}a myth punctured by the rigorous studies of Lazarsfeld and others, which showed time and again that media impact is in fact limited. This storyline, first narrated in Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's Personal Influence (1955), remains textbook boilerplate and literature review dogma fifty years later. The dissertation traces the emergence of this '' powerful-to-limited effects'' disciplinary legend, with special emphasis on the surprising contributions of sociologist Edward Shils, the mandarin theorist and intellectual maverick with little interest in the empirical study of media. In the crucial postwar years, Shils provided an account of the disappearance and reemergence of '' small group'' research, which he framed as a contrast between pictures of society\textemdash{}between the mistaken European view of impersonal isolation as against his view, that Gemeinschaft elements endure. Shils's treatment of small-group research, and especially his embedding of that story in terms of societal imagery, was essential to the field's mnemonic emplotment. Shils had his own intellectual reasons for narrating the history in the manner that he did\textemdash{}reasons rooted in his evolving and deeply engaged search for the underpinnings of modern social order. In a sense, however, his reasons did not matter once the narrative itself was released to the American sociological public; Lazarsfeld and Katz had their own reasons for adopting the historical picture that Shils put forward\textemdash{}reasons largely centered on scholarly competition and norms of originality. The powerful-to-limited-effects narrative in Personal Influence, in turn, was so widely embraced in the late 1950s for a still-different set of reasons\textemdash{}because of the scholarly support it lent to the public intellectual defense of American popular culture, in the context of an evolving Cold War liberalism. The staying power of this limited-effects narrative was ultimately guaranteed, however, by the newly institutionalized, would-be discipline of '' communication''\textemdash{}which retained the storyline as a usable, and teachable, past.},

  abstract = {The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by statute in 1972. This action built on a long history in this country of interest in examining the wider societal implications of science and technology. More specifically, it followed a decade of work by (what are now called) the Science Committee of the House of Representatives and the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate with the help of the private academic and industrial sectors, in particular the National Academy of Sciences. During the ensuing 23 years, under the guidance of an equally bipartisan congressional Board, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} evolved a structure and a process which provided analysis, information, and options to Congress and a reputation for nonpartisan, accurate and complete reporting. Importantly, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} also provided, through the intense use as advisers of experts and stakeholders from the nongovernmental sector, an open interface between many American communities and Congress. The description of the justification, history, structure, and procedures of \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} affords a perspective on the abrupt abolishment of the agency in the first session of the 104th Congress. A number of explanatory factors rather than a single one were likely responsible for OTA's elimination and are noted. The implications of abolishing \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} are also discussed.},

By mid-century, mass communications researchers had become recognized as experts in describing the effects of the mass media on learning and other social behavior. However, the conditions that promoted and sustained their authority as experts have not been adequately explored.

  abstract = {In The Citizen Audience, Richard Butsch explores the cultural and political history of audiences in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present. He demonstrates that, while attitudes toward audiences have shifted over time, Americans have always judged audiences against standards of good citizenship. From descriptions of tightly packed crowds in early American theaters to the contemporary reports of distant, anonymous Internet audiences, Butsch examines how audiences were represented in contemporary discourse. He explores a broad range of sources on theater, movies, propaganda, advertising, broadcast journalism, and much more. Butsch discovers that audiences were characterized according to three recurrent motifs: as crowds and as isolated individuals in a mass, both of which were considered bad, and as publics which were considered ideal audiences. These images were based on and reinforced class and other social hierarchies. At times though, subordinate groups challenged their negative characterization in these images, and countered with their own interpretations. A remarkable work of cultural criticism and media history, this book is essential reading for anyone seeking an historical understanding of how audiences, media and entertainment function in the American cultural and political imagination.},

Specifically, the discussion groups disciplinary histories into 2 different kinds of narratives, referred to as biographical and intellectual histories. The first group has as its method biography, and focuses on the achievement of central individuals and the methodology of their research. It is argued that these accounts constitute rituals of disciplinary affirmation. The second group has as its method intellectual history, and focuses on the theoretical foundations of ideas taken up by communication scholars, tracing the relations among ideology, culture, technology, and communication. These accounts, on the other hand, are read as polite rebellions against received understandings of communication history.},

This introductory essay illustrates the needs for such a volume to fill an important gap in IC history, provides a rationale for focusing on the 1970s, and discusses the current state of documenting various expressions of the intercultural discipline. It highlights the value of biography as one historical window from which to review or reconstruct the social history derived from the interdisciplinary influences and outcomes of IC or related intercultural fields. After a brief review of earlier people and tracks that influenced the field's eventual formation, it provides categorical and chronological summaries of people and their initiatives in and around the 1970s that established IC, the rationale that guided inclusions or omissions for this '' selected'' set of biographies, and highlights other worthy influencers not profiled. This essay provides an overview for the questions that contributing authors were asked to address about each person featured in this special issue: (1) the ways they founded, influenced, or affected the ongoing IC field or related intercultural work, (2) the topics or domains that they influenced, (3) the lines or types of IC they launched and outcomes of their legacies, and (4) the principles, practices, or personal characteristics those in the field now can reconsider as catalysts for renewal or future developments.},

In Refiguring Mass Communication, Peter Simonson compares his own vision of mass communication with distinct views articulated throughout history by Paul of Tarsus, Walt Whitman, Charles Horton Cooley, David Sarnoff, and Robert K. Merton, utilizing a collection of texts and tenets from a variety of time periods and perspectives. Drawing on textual and archival research as well as access to Merton's personal papers, Simonson broadly reconceives a sense of communication theory and what social processes might be considered species of mass communication. Simonson reveals the geographical and social contexts from which these visions have emerged and the religious and moral horizons against which they have taken shape. In a unique perspective, he considers the American county fair as an example of a live gathering and crucial site that is overlooked in contemporary forms of mass communication, urging a reconsideration of how individuals participate in and shape similar forms.},

The paper presents his thoughts on the past 10 years of marketing scholarship, his views on future directions and some advice for those looking to publish their research in academic journals. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a reflective, discursive approach, and also reviews a wide range of topics relevant to marketing researchers. Findings The author finds that EJM has grown substantially on many levels in the past decade. He also finds that there are some concerns around marketing research, and social scientific scholarship in general, that marketing scholars may wish to consider and take into account in their ongoing work. Research limitations/implications The paper is partly a personal view, and does not rely on any empirical research. However, the views espoused are justified by theoretical review and conceptual argument. Practical implications The implications of this paper are relevant to marketing scholars, journal reviewers, readers of research, as well as those who manage scholarship (e.g. university administrators). The author suggests a number of directions that the research, publication and reward process could move in to improve practice. Originality/value The paper brings together a large number of different views and concepts relevant to further development of marketing research, and provides original summaries and extensions.},

  abstract = {Although Japan had its own distinctive 'pre-history' of cultural studies, which produced some excellent research on popular culture, which can be traced back to the 1920s, the current state of cultural studies has been criticized by conventional mainstream academics; whereas the younger generation has been attracted by cultural studies as a new academic trend. An important new development in cultural studies in Japan is Cultural Typhoon. This new movement seeks to avoid institutionalization and create an alternative academic public sphere alongside broadened cultural practices, social activities and political interventions. Cultural studies in Japan can be seen as a part of a new diversity in cultural studies, which has some potentialities to move beyond the academy and open new dialogical spaces for communication and cultural intervention.},

Situated at the crossroads of philosophy, theology, anthropology, archaeology, history, sociology, political sciences, semiotics, media and cultural studies, mediology is a relatively autonomous discipline that analyses the totality of the processes of mediation that intervene between culture and agency, and transform ideas into a material force. Mediology or mediation studies broadens the notion of media so as to include all material and institutional vectors of communication and defines mediation as the totality of interactions between culture and technology that make the diffusion (through space) and the transmission (over time) of ideas possible.},

Drawing on a variety of archival materials for evidence of the commission's thinking, this essay argues that the concept of accountability was originally intended as a guide to policy making and that, to appreciate the continuing relevance of the commission's work as a landmark in media studies, it is essential to understand the policy orientation that underlay most of its ideas and recommendations.},

While The 'Nationwide' Audience has been acclaimed as one of the most influential empirical works in audience studies, it has been often misunderstood as if the work failed to find out systemic and consistent influences of viewers' social conditions on decoding practices. On the contrary, by using a statistical method, this paper demonstrates that the audiences' decodings of the programme presented by Morley are in fact clearly patterned by their social positions. The findings reveal the over-determined effects of various social conditions such as class, gender, race and age. Particularly, the results seem to restore the importance of social class on the interpretive process, which has been displaced and ignored in many current media studies. Highlighting audiences' structural social positions, the reading patterns rediscovered here allow us to rebut not only the traditional Marxist view of class determinism but also any relativist accounts of cultural activity.},

The author focuses specifically on the problems that proceed from this textualist model by examining its internal limitations and the questions and lines of critical analysis it forecloses. Against this model, the author argues that Pierre Bourdieu 's sociological theory offers a necessary corrective to the lack of self-reflexivity and critical insight that has resulted from the domidnance of this paradigm within media studies.},

This article will summarise this work, and will also explore how some of Williams's more general key theoretical concepts \textendash{} especially structure of feeling and selective tradition \textendash{} can be applied to the genre. Finally, it will argue that the 'sociological' turn, by which Williams sought to substitute description and explanation for judgement and canonisation as the central purposes of analysis, represents a more productive approach to science fiction studies than the kind of prescriptive criticism deployed by other avowedly 'neo-Marxist' works, such as Darko Suvin's Metamorphoses of Science Fiction and Fredric Jameson's Archaeologies of the Future.},

It was hard to say which of us was more alienated. Williams had made the long trek from a rural working-class community in Wales to a college which seemed to judge people (as I was to find out later to my cost) by how often they dined at High Table. He looked and spoke more like a countryman than a don, and had a warmth and simplicity of manner which contrasted sharply with the suave, off-hand style of the upper middle class establishment. He never got used to the casual malice of the Senior Combination Room, and was to write years later, in a fine obituary of F.R. Leavis, that Cambridge was 'one of the rudest places on earth . . . shot through with cold, nasty and bloody-minded talk'. I found myself marooned within a student body where everyone seemed to be well over six foot, brayed rather than spoke, stamped their feet in cinemas at the feeblest joke and addressed each other like public meetings in intimate cafes.

  abstract = {This essay explores the use of Walter Lippmann's ideas in three areas of mass communications research: message-driven media effects research and related studies of agenda setting, priming, and framing; social histories of U.S. journalism, advertising, and public relations; and interpretive accounts of the field's genesis. It offers a new understanding of the role Lippmann played in yoking together a range of communication-related issues under a single problematic. In the process it exposes a critical lacunae stretching across (and beyond) scholarship in communications research: a lack of attention to the rhetorical deployment of Lippmann, characterized by an inclination to endow this figure's political philosophy with the power to stand in for a range of developments occurring across an emerging communications field. This essay addresses the implications of being positioned to speak not only for a field of research but for history as well, being able to so perfectly mirror shifts in cultural attitudes and emerging institutional practices.},

Here, comprehending the notion of the West is considered significant, as it offers a model of comparison. While it is not necessary for the perspectives and process to be radical, it should be convincing to grasp Asia as a formation of a changeable force to the West. Of course, media scholars have to avoid limited perspectives emphasizing only intra-Asian dialogues; instead they must analyze Asian perspectives in the globalization context. What non-Western scholars must contemplate are not only paradigms that are unique to Asian society but also general trends and norms that apply to the globe so that they can identify new trends and directions, which provide fundamentals to advance new theories and norms in global media studies. This certainly contributes to a broadening of media theory and comprehension in a way that takes account of the practices of non-Western countries outside the Anglo-American sphere. },

  abstract = {In this article, I reflect on the theoretical rise of the public sphere in the 1990s from the vantage point of South Korea, connecting this approach to the broader context of the global post–Cold War transition. The case of South Korea – a postcolonial, authoritarian country with deep geopolitical connections to the West – offers a node of the global embrace of the public sphere in the 1990s for theorizing the transformation of authoritarian countries into liberal capitalist democracies, elevating the distinction between state and civil society as a prominent focus. However, the establishment of authoritarian public spheres in Asia and the illiberal turn of public spheres in the Global North in the 2010s call upon scholars to identify relevant questions regarding current public spheres while addressing what essential components define the public sphere. Here, I call for critical attention to the loci of power and oppression, to the production of critical practices within a particular social configuration, and to coexistence within a civil society. I end the article by proposing a set of suggestions for reading, theorizing, and teaching public sphere theories. },

It specifically implies a decentring of the discipline of art history towards the interdisciplinary study of sociocultural visibilities. This paper deals with the development of this research field in an intellectual climate still characterised by the ‘Culture Wars’ engaged in by the neoconservatives against certain areas of the academy and the artistic world during the 1980s. By taking into account the struggles about Visual Studies inside the intellectual Left as an integral part of their definition, this paper analyses the academic politicisations of the notions of ‘Visual Culture’ (culture visuelle) and ‘Visual Studies’ (études visuelles) in the context of the current French importation and redefinition of these categories. },

  abstract = { The late twentieth century visual turn established the study of visual culture as central to the humanities and social sciences. Yet there is no consensus over the scope of the field that has come to be known as visual studies. This article offers a dialectical account in response. It finds a precedent in two dialectical models that have been prominent in visual studies, namely those of Walter Benjamin and Maurice Merleau-Ponty. It argues that the work of Merleau-Ponty offers the better model for a contemporary dialectic because it is not tied to a particular ideological position. Merleau-Ponty’s work can be used to ground a dialectic of visual culture which begins with the eye and has as its three main moments the life-world, representation, and technology. Each of these three moments is explored in turn in order to demonstrate that this is a genuine dialectic in the sense that the final stage returns to the initial position but leaves it thoroughly transformed. The advantage of this approach is that it yields, for the first time, an account of the study of visual culture that does not rely on ideological or methodological principles to explain the range of the field. },

  abstract = {Widespread concerns about new technologies—whether they be novels, radios, or smartphones—are repeatedly found throughout history. Although tales of past panics are often met with amusement today, current concerns routinely engender large research investments and policy debate. What we learn from studying past technological panics, however, is that these investments are often inefficient and ineffective. What causes technological panics to repeatedly reincarnate? And why does research routinely fail to address them? To answer such questions, I examined the network of political, population, and academic factors driving the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics. In this cycle, psychologists are encouraged to spend time investigating new technologies, and how they affect children and young people, to calm a worried population. Their endeavor, however, is rendered ineffective because of the lack of a theoretical baseline; researchers cannot build on what has been learned researching past technologies of concern. Thus, academic study seemingly restarts for each new technology of interest, which slows down the policy interventions necessary to ensure technologies are benefiting society. In this article, I highlight how the Sisyphean cycle of technology panics stymies psychology’s positive role in steering technological change and the pervasive need for improved research and policy approaches to new technologies. },

  abstract = {This article explores Wyndham Lewis's experience of the First World War, and its influence on his varied artistic output. It interrogates how Lewis's initial ambivalence towards an emergent technological society shifted through direct encounters with mechanized warfare, and speculates on the effect of these upon his post-war writing and criticism. By contrasting Lewis's thought against that of his Italian Futurist contemporaries, I will demonstrate the centrality of their divergent conceptions of masculinity in accounting for this opposition – and how Lewis's critique of technological society prefigures contemporary opposition towards the post-humanist philosophy of Accelerationism. },

  abstract = {Caillois’s classic text Man, Play and Games leaves open a basic question: Why focus on four specific kinds of play? Subsequent authors have offered their own rationalizations and expanded upon his game categories but have not explained Caillois’s approach. This essay performs a close reading of Man, Play and Games in order to evince his methodology. I argue that Caillois holds to the idea that play reproduces uncertainty in a safe and confined way but that a paradox troubles this vision and pushes him into a baroque formalism. Instead of a simple relation between model and copy, Caillois develops another, stranger concept of mimesis that continues and extends his Surrealist writing about insects and the unconscious. My reading builds on previous analyses of Caillois within game studies, sociology, and media theory to revise the methodological presuppositions built into the categorization of games. },

@article{doi:10.1080/24701475.2019.1704495,
  abstract = {Our goal in this article is to understand the historical sequences as well as consequences of the internet on the development of the academic field of communication. As a field that has one foot in the study of a most basic and necessary human activity, and another foot in the study of innovative technology, has scholarship in the field of communication followed internet developments? Is there a lag between technological developments and communication research focused on those developments? We attempt to answer our questions by searching for keywords (such as computer, internet, CMC, etc.) in content from communication journals from 1970 to 2000. We find that a large number of keywords were entirely absent, and many of the occurrences involved the same small number of terms, indicative of a relatively narrow and/or shallow amount of interest in these phenomena. The dominance of terms like ‘computer’ and ‘internet’ (and, eventually, ‘Web’) indicate a generalist tone at work in these articles. There is relatively little breadth in the vocabulary related to computers and the internet, suggesting that the field of communication that was seemingly trying to digest the entire (constructed) category of behavior associated with computers and the internet in one gigantic linguistic bite rather than focusing on activities taking place via this new medium. There was not yet a sense of meaningful differentiation in what internet-based communication could involve; ‘internet’ communication was simply communication occurring by means of an internet-based delivery system; a new medium, figuratively and literally. },

Convinced that the report was “part of a plot” to destroy the First Amendment, McCormick underwrote a 642-page rebuttal, Prejudice and the Press: A Restatement of the Principle of Freedom of the Press with Specific Reference to the Hutchins-Luce Commission, by Tribune reporter Frank Hughes. The story behind Prejudice and the Press represents an unknown chapter in the midcentury battle between conservative publishers and liberal press critics. Although Prejudice and the Press is meandering, snide, and suffused with red-baiting, it effectively rebuts a key foundation of A Free and Responsible Press. },

It asks how and to what extent these three political regimes conceptualized propaganda as a knowledge-based practice and what kind of expertise they mobilized. Although American propaganda strategists were the only ones to make use of modern social science methods as part of their activities, under the difficult circumstances of ongoing war operations, the practices of knowledge production by military intelligence did not fundamentally differ between the three countries. The war profoundly changed the way knowledge was systematically mobilized for political and military purposes, and transnational entanglements, perceptions, and observations (but also misperceptions and projections) played a crucial role in that development. This directly connects World War II developments to the emergence of a Cold War regime of producing and using scientific knowledge for strategic purposes. },

  abstract = {For more than a century—dating as far back as 1907, when the first German-language film publications were initially established—Filmkritik (criticism, historiography, all manner of cultural discourse on cinema) has been a prized form of expression, a thriving intellectual, journalistic, and professional enterprise. More limited in scope at the start, it quickly blossomed during the Wilhelmine and Habsburg Empires, through the interwar and postwar periods, and into the twenty-first century. Over the years it has faced numerous challenges: the political rifts of the twentieth century (including the Third Reich and the East-West divide), the technological shifts of the medium and the modes of writing about it (from silent to sound pictures, print to digital), the exigencies of archival initiatives and film preservation. At the same time, from its beginnings Filmkritik has been a relentlessly international affair, traversing national borders and transcending the limits of language and origin. Moreover, Filmkritik has persistently crossed the Atlantic due not only to the migration of prominent critics and filmmakers themselves but to the receptive audiences and readerships on both sides.},

  abstract = {Focusing on the interwar writings of the film journalist and theorist Béla Balázs, this article argues for an understanding of Balázs’s film aesthetics as grounded in a popular politics of the body. Balázs understood film as a medium in which experiences of image, sound, and expressive movement and gesture shape human subjectivities within a newly mediatized social realm. The article explores Balázs’s consequent plea for a film politics of popular embodiment and asks what a survey of Balázs’s writings as both critic and theorist tell us about the political valences of his film theory now.},

  abstract = {Film criticism helped constitute what is now called New Austrian Cinema. This article looks at “short form” criticism in edited volumes and emerging journals that worked to establish this cinema’s coherence and prestige. The virtuous cycle inaugurated in the 1990s—when critics wrote with great acuity about recent films, and filmmakers seemed to work to meet heightened expectations—has continued with full-length monographs for a wider audience in the new millennium. This development, however, has not been without its detractors. Specifically, Michael Haneke’s Caché (2005) can be interpreted as an ambivalent statement about the power of the critic.},

  abstract = {The often bemoaned crisis of West German cinema in the 1980s coincided with a dramatic changing of the nation’s film critical guard. The symptomatic impetus that had figured so strongly during the postwar era gave way to the so-called new subjectivism of young critics like Michael Althen, Claudius Seidl, and Andreas Kilb. They looked askance at the formal complexity and political activism of most art house fare and above all found themselves smitten by mainstream American features. Taking their cue from Susan Sontag and her essay “Against Interpretation,” these postmodern existentialists cultivated a highly personalized, indeed rarefied form of poetic empiricism. This study analyzes their sensibility and rhetoric, their emphases and oversights. It focuses on Dominik Graf’s essay film, Was heißt hier Ende? (Then Is It the End?, 2015), a tribute to Althen and the cohort of young critics with whom he worked and interacted.},

Leaving aside reviews that have already been translated elsewhere, and focusing almost exclusively on the silent period, the present selection was guided by two considerations. First, it includes reviews of several films that have entered the canon of world cinema (The Last Laugh, The Blue Angel, The Man with the Movie Camera, Girls in Uniform). Second, it reflects Kracauer’s attraction, particularly during the early 1920s, to American slapstick.},

Our findings describe comparative studies of Internet use as an increasingly diverse topic in terms of its widespread publication outlets across different (sub)fields in communication studies, along with emerging dimensions of comparison. Meanwhile, conventional pitfalls and limits remain, including the easily ignored consideration and justification of equivalence and comparability in the research object and the analytical method, as well as the remaining dominant cross-territorial perspective and quantitative methods. We offer corresponding proposals to overcome pitfalls and advance future comparative studies of Internet use and, in a broader sense, comparative communication research.},

  abstract = {This article outlines the development of the history of the book not only as an academic discipline in its own right but as a field of study of critical, potentially central, importance for the advancement of the humanities in general. The history of the book helps revise the earlier relative marginalisation of cultural vis-à-vis political history. The publication in 1958 of L’apparition du livre by Lucien Febvre and Henri-Jean Martin has been followed by a series of multivolume, multi-authored national histories of the book and libraries, first in France, then in Britain, the United States and elsewhere. The history of book is having considerable influence in many areas of historical investigation, such as general history, literary history, the history of science and the history of religion. With the ‘Digital Revolution’, the history of the book is now converging with studies of the other media and, together with the growth of postcolonial/post-imperial studies in general, offers the prospect of a balanced and nuanced approach within the global academy to understanding the world’s media past, present and future. },

  abstract = {This article argues that in the development of media studies and cultural studies, a gap opened between textual analysis and political economy that became a damaging schism. The roots of the schism between the economic and the cultural lie in the growing influence of French structuralism, and post-structuralism from the late 1960s onwards. Jim McGuigan’s book, Cultural Populism, appeared at a time when socialist politics, political analysis and cultural theory were, both together and separately, in a degree of flux, self-reflection and loss of direction. This article outlines the nature of the split between emphasis on the cultural and the economic, the ways in which it continues to mark the field and the importance of continuing to try and hold the two together in the analytic frame. Methodologically, this article involves analysis of Cultural Populism and utilises document and archive searching, interviews, syllabus analysis and personal communication. },

I deepen this argument by outlining the history of ‘popular education’ in Europe and beyond in the modern period to illustrate how the coming together of subaltern political movements and intellectual inquiry created an independent public sphere of radical self-enlightenment. In this article, by utilising archival and textual sources, I should like to explore whether it may be possible to renew the original project of Cultural Studies through radical programmes of ‘popular’ adult education in the digital age. I see Jim McGuigan’s work as offering ‘resources of hope’, in Raymond Williams’ phrase, for this tradition in the universe of academic Cultural Studies. },

  abstract = {In Cultural Populism, Jim McGuigan argues that in British cultural studies ‘there is populist sentiment, but hardly any “sentimentality” is discernible’. There is, however, an arena of British cultural studies that has always been concerned with ‘sentiment’ and that is the romance narrative. This article argues that the study of popular fictions has always been integral to the history of cultural studies, and that it established a site in which feminist voices would make gender politics intrinsic to the field. At a time when gender was not a central issue for either Literature or Cultural Studies, generic fictions written by and for women provided a site for research that was undeniably about female experience, and the analysis of those texts offered a strategy for asserting a feminist focus. },

  abstract = {This article unpacks the concept of ‘cultural populism’ in multiple ways, and explores its value for the critical analysis of new formations and expressions of populism in the current conjuncture. Taking Jim McGuigan’s influential book, Cultural Populism, as our point of departure, we begin by exploring its earlier use in cultural studies as a critical term for apolitical/celebratory modes of analysis, and then argue it may be usefully extended today to refer to popular and political efforts to construct a ‘people’ in overtly cultural terms. Second, we make the case for renewing an expressly ‘critical populist’ stance, one that is attentive to ordinary tastes and pleasures, while also locating and analysing them in relation to the production of needs and desires within a capitalist political economy, and that is attuned to the political possibilities for change. Third, we argue that the resources of cultural studies should be mobilised to redress some of the deficiencies of dominant accounts of populism from political science, and suggest that the twin concepts of cultural and critical populism offer an advance over the elitist and culturally reductive mode of analysis associated with Inglehart and Norris’ conception of ‘cultural backlash’. We conclude by offering an overview of the other contributions to the special issue, as they seek to push the concept of cultural populism in new directions, while also critically engaging with residual, dominant and emergent popular and populist currents in these new populist times. },

  abstract = {As Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney for over 20 years (1978–2001), György Márkus exerted a profound influence on a generation of philosophers and students from many disciplinary backgrounds. His legendary lecture courses, spanning the history of modern philosophy from the Enlightenment through to the late 20th century, were memorable for their breadth, erudition, and philosophical drama. Always modest despite his mastery of the tradition, Márkus’s approach to this history of philosophy never failed to emphasize its continuing role in shaping our inherited understanding of philosophy as ‘its own time comprehended in thoughts’ (Hegel). This is especially true of his contribution to the philosophical discourse of modernity, which we could summarize as comprising an original philosophy of cultural modernity. In what follows, I briefly reconstruct Márkus’s account of the adventures of the concept of culture, focusing on his definitive essay ‘The Path of Culture: From the Refined to the High, From the Popular to Mass Culture’ (2013) but also referring to other relevant Márkus texts, offering some critical remarks on his account of culture and its relationship with modern aesthetics, both classical and contemporary. },

How did the discipline and practice of development communication begin? Who were the founders and how were the first experiments implemented? Rejecting the ideologically populist views that locates development communication origins within western development scholarship, the following postcolonist exposé appraises various communication uses in development that emerged from different parts of the world in the past 50 years. The discussion holds that the pioneering development communication experiments were located between postcolonial and underdevelopment theories, and as such, to understand its origins, a study must focus on the earliest non-commissioned and community-originated experiments, as this study purports to do. },

It defines the meaning and function of Mitteilung in contradistinction with the notion of empathy and thus demonstrates its distinct generative constitution. I propose that Mitteilung has the capacity to cancel the ‘operative’ opposition between social acts and instinctive intersubjectivity and thus to frame a non-determinist theory of sociality. This capacity is largely ignored by the dominant interpretation, according to which the concept of communication in Husserl is derivative of the more fundamental category of empathy. A major consequence to this argument is that it determines why eminent readers of Husserl such as Derrida have missed an important opportunity when they failed to notice the distinct role of Mitteilung. This alternative view is expanded onto communication media in general by taking Kittler’s project as a vantage point. },

  abstract = {This article reanimates the Adorno–Benjamin debate to investigate the potential of contemporary technologised consumer culture to become a space for bottom-up political agency and resistance. For both Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin, the technological advancement of the 20th century had an inherently irrational character, as evidenced by the self-destructive tendencies of humanity during the Second World War. Nonetheless, the thinkers famously disagreed when it came to the implications of the marriage between technology and mass culture. Discerning its potential for the mobilisation of the masses, Benjamin believed that technology would politicise mass culture, allowing society to employ it for its political ends – an idea which Adorno debunked. Technologised consumer culture has noticeably evolved since the time of the debate. Nevertheless, revisiting the debate is necessary to understand a contradiction between the expanded possibilities for political participation and the return of the ‘auratic’ or cultic function of technologised consumer culture. At the same time, the article shows that technology does politicise consumer culture. However, the pitfall lies in that the politicisation is done through technology as a tool, which is vulnerable to appropriation, granting those who are in the position to control it a substantial political resource. Consequently, the article argues that the politicisation of consumer culture risks having a reverse effect of facilitating the aestheticising of politics – turning politics into a spectacle. },

  abstract = {Concerns about selective exposure and disinformation in the digital news environment have brought the concept of news diversity to the forefront of academic debates. Despite its growing prominence in scholarly work, however, news diversity often remains hard to grasp. The current paper aims to re-assess what the concept of news diversity means in an evolving news ecology. To do so, we draw on three dominant conceptualizations of news and media diversity. We use their strengths to unravel the variety in conceptualizations of news diversity and to explain how diversity is built on different conceptual and normative assumptions towards news media and democracy. Based on these insights, we perform a systematic literature review in which we map the current communication science literature that address news diversity. Results show that 43 different news diversity dimensions have been used in literature, indicating a form of academic cherry-picking with both normative and conceptual implications. We propose a way forward by formulating recommendations for future diversity research. This includes a shift to a more theoretically grounded approach in conceptualizing news diversity, a call for interdisciplinary research, and giving the idea of normativity a more pronounced place in research on news diversity. },

The author is critical of diffusion research in Latin America because of its too-close copying of the "made-in-the-USA" classical diffusion model. The theoretical approach of Paulo Freire's "conscientization" is recommended as one corrective influence on the diffusion model in Latin America and elsewhere. },

This article examines academic discourse and asks how research on the multifaceted internet has evolved over the past 25 years. In order to investigate the formation of this academic field, we collected articles published in major academic journals dedicated to new media and digital communication as well as mainstream periodicals in communication studies over the past quarter of a century. Relying on a combination of (semi)automated content analysis and citation analysis, we find that articles related to the internet and its manifold aspects are cited more often than research on other topics. The literature review suggests that as the socio-material infrastructure of the internet has become deeply enmeshed in society its study has evolved from a niche pursuit to the discipline’s core area of inquiry. },

Most of the 300 Africans who graduated the African Training Scheme’s six-month-long course already were working at newspapers, radio stations and government ministries—often where British expatriates were leaving. The exposure to Western professional practices boosted many of their careers. The IPI’s Nairobi school operated from 1963 to 1968 and was ‘probably the most effective’ of the more than a half dozen crash courses that sought, largely successfully, to put a Western stamp on African journalism education. Finally, both Ford and the IPI prized the network of journalists and officials they had forged almost as much as the education they had provided. },

  abstract = {This essay presents a detailed analysis of Georg Simon Ohm’s acoustical research between 1839 and 1844. Because of its importance in Hermann von Helmholtz’s subsequent study of sound and hearing, this work is rarely considered on its own terms. A thorough assessment of Ohm’s articles, however, can greatly enrich our understanding of later developments. Based on study of Ohm’s published writings, as well as a lengthy unpublished manuscript, the essay argues that his acoustical research foreshadows an important paradigmatic shift at a time of discursive instability prior to Helmholtz’s influential contributions. Using Ohm’s own dismissal of his supposedly “unmusical ears” as a conceptual frame, the essay describes this shift as a move away from understanding sound primarily in a musical context and toward an increasingly mathematical approach to sound and hearing. As such, Ohm’s work also anticipates a more general change in the role of the senses in nineteenth-century scientific research. },

  abstract = {This article proposes to view Freire’s thinking beyond a pedagogical method and rather as a model or even paradigm of development and social change. To build this as an original argument we firstly outline Freire’s ontological call, presenting and discussing his underlying five principles, of which one in particular, dialogue, situates Freirean thinking within communication theory. Secondly, we trace Freire’s legacy by presenting and discussing how Freire inspired three significant Ibero-American thinkers and practitioners within performing arts (Augusto Boal), communication (Juan Diaz Bordenave) and epistemology of change (Boaventura de Sousa Santos). This analysis underscores Freire’s significant legacy along global intellectual pathways both within humanities and social sciences. Finally, we deepen our analysis of Freire’s vision of development and social change, unpacking how he navigates between a normative vision grounded in a utopian aspiration for change, and a very systematic and rigorous methodology, his liberating pedagogy. },

  abstract = {Journalism scholars have acknowledged the importance of innovation in journalism. A common finding is that journalism has difficulty adapting to change and uses multiple coping mechanisms, including making excuses for not innovating by relying on their professional norms and practices. However, such research does not more broadly show how journalism studies research has shaped what scholars have learned about innovation practices. The goal of this study is to provide a systematic literature review of news innovation research since the 1990s. This article deploys a qualitative content analysis of peer-reviewed journal articles about news innovation in media and journalism studies. It shows that journalism and media scholars discuss news innovation as normative, participative, and experimentative. Journalism studies scholarship has also focused on innovation as a process, integrating elements of audience engagement, structure, system, and network. The goal of this study is twofold. First, it discusses the methodological and conceptual/theoretical approaches taken in scholarly journal articles about news innovation. Second, it outlines limitations of such approaches and draws conclusions to conceptualize knowledge in this subfield of research. It argues that it is important to take into account those limitations, as they pose problems for the cumulative nature of news innovation research knowledge. },

This article starts with a brief overview of the research conducted in translation studies. The next two sections discuss the conceptualization of “translation” in the two disciplines and highlight the historical importance of translation in news production respectively. The topic of “conflict” is discussed in the next section as an example of the importance of translation in news production and dissemination. Finally, the paper considers possible interdisciplinary research areas between translation and journalism studies focusing on theoretical and methodological issues. },

  abstract = {This article examines the collaborations between Marshall McLuhan, the architectural historian Sigfried Giedion, and the modernist town planner Jaqueline Tyrwhitt in the 1950s. Giedion’s studies of everyday material culture and his concern with the human scale of cities became central to McLuhan’s proposal for studying media. Through a historical analysis of Tyrwhitt’s papers and correspondence, the paper documents her role in mediating a dialogue between McLuhan and Giedion and in co-founding, with McLuhan and others, the Explorations Group at the University of Toronto. Drawing upon Giedion’s concern with the humanization of urban life, Tyrwhitt helped formulate a methodology that used the urban environment and architecture as the framework to analyze the effects of media. The paper argues that Tyrwhitt’s own contributions to the Explorations journal took up both Giedion and McLuhan’s focus on media and material culture and their commitment to interdisciplinarity in examining the mediated experience of urban life.Résumé : Cet article examine les collaborations pendant les années 50 entre Marshall McLuhan, l’historien de l’architecture Sigfried Giedion et l’urbaniste moderniste Jaqueline Tyrwhitt. Les études de la culture matérielle de tous les jours effectuées par Giedion et son souci d’assurer une dimension humaine aux villes sont devenus des éléments centraux dans l’approche aux médias proposée par McLuhan. Cet article, au moyen d’une analyse historique des archives et de la correspondance de Tyrwhitt, recense le rôle que celle-ci a joué pour encourager un dialogue entre McLuhan et Giedion et pour établir, avec McLuhan et d’autres, le groupe Explorations à l’Université de Toronto. Tyrwhitt, s’inspirant de la volonté de Giedion d’humaniser la vie urbaine, a contribué à l’élaboration d’une méthodologie qui se rapporte à l’environnement urbain et à l’architecture pour analyser les effets des médias. Cet article soutient que les contributions de Tyrwhitt à la revue Explorations ont tenu compte à la fois de l’accent mis par engagement interdisciplinaire afin d’étudier les expériences médiatisées de la vie urbaine.},

After pointing out some of the real political-economic forces at work in setting the contours of this intellectual turn, I discuss how spaces between mutually constructed but overlapping paradigmatic understandings of media behavior lead to theories that serve as boundary objects, linking (and misunderstanding) older fields in order to advance new agendas. I then turn to the consequences of particular methodological choices, drawing on key works in Science and Technology Studies (STS) to make the point that these methodological choices not only establish scientific fields, they construct certain types of human subjects as well. The article concludes with a call for a more humanistic and interpretive approach to the understanding of political behavior and communication.},

These interrelated features articulate the central dimensions of journalism studies, establishing the boundaries of the field and its relational, cultural, holistic, ecological, and contextual acts of scholarship.

Therefore, it examines both the habitus and the capital of the 26 communication researchers from outside the United States who have been distinguished as ICA presidents and fellows. The study contributes to the discipline’s reflexivity and shows that despite the expansion of ICA’s leadership, the field’s power pole is still a U.S.-centered enterprise. Today, ICA’s international leadership is located in world regions closely linked to the United States and educated at U.S. universities or heavily influenced by North American research traditions, even if it includes a numerous contributions from other associations and alternative approaches. Consequently, this internationalization hardly changed ICA but instead changed the world’s communication field. At least up to a certain extent, new perspectives are perceived at the discipline’s power pole. However, in return, national academic environments in U.S.-affiliated countries became Americanized, especially via ICA fellows serving as role models to get scientific capital. Thus, ICA’s efforts to expand its leadership are assumed to have an unintended effect of conserving the power structures in the field.},

  abstract = {This article develops the concept of «operational media» to think through the deployment of utility/useful cinema in the context of cybernetically informed educational policy. The paper argues that cybernetic concepts of communication, feedback loops and homeostasis were central to the pragmatic installation of media at the center of postwar mass education. Links are made to the dominance of cybernetic ideas in postwar social science, including social psychology, sociobiology and behaviourism. A consideration of the UN’s operational media allows for a reconsideration of the agency’s communicative mandate as biopolitical and governmental. Educational policies influenced by the UN were doubly concerned with technologized classrooms: cybernetic ideas presented themselves as politically neutral, while offering efficiencies in the delivery of content. Cold war citizenship was thus conceived as a form of training that would pragmatically lead to the rebalancing of a volatile international situation. Carrefour de la vie (1949), made by Belgian filmmaker Henri Storck for the United Nations, is presented as an example of the centrality of mental health for citizenship training in postwar biopolitical regimes. In particular, the tension between the film’s humanist and cybernetic strands are considered. Au Carrefour de la vie is considered as a transitional text, presenting a humanist story of childhood in postwar life that simultaneously prefigures the operation of a controlled society.},

As soon as the Board's staff began work on improving US psychological operations, they wondered how social science might help them achieve their task. Board Director, Gordon Gray, asked physicist turned research administrator Henry Loomis to do a full review of America's social science research program in support of psychological operations. Loomis willingly accepted the task. This paper documents Loomis's investigation into America's social science research program. It uncovers the critical role that government departments had in the creation of research in the early 1950s and thus highlights that the government official is an important actor in the history of social science and the application of social science to psychological operations at the beginning of the Cold War.},

  abstract = {The rise of social media has recently inspired a renewed debate about the decentering of the subject. Some scholars have responded to Facebook’s seemingly intrusive influence over people’s emotions by reviving humanistic notions of the autonomous subject, while others have continued to insist on the subject’s constructedness. This article provides a historical perspective on this issue by revisiting another moment that, in some ways, parallels contemporary anxieties about social media. In the mid-18th century, critics worried that the increasing popularity of reading was producing unruly emotions and extreme opinions. These concerns inspired a number of attempts to reassert the primacy of spoken language, including programs of elocution instruction that trained people in reading out loud. Focusing on James Burgh’s 1761 book The Art of Speaking, this article argues that the elocution movement employed a different conception of selfhood from the modern notion of subjectivity: rather than treating the subject as the ultimate source of emotion, the elocutionists judged emotional reactions to texts based on a normative notion of the general good. I argue that this ethically grounded view of the self could provide a useful framework for understanding the stakes of the present anxiety about the emotional effects of media. },

  abstract = { AbstractScholars in both digital humanities and media studies have noted an apparent disconnect between computation and the interpretive methods of the humanities. Alan Liu has argued that literary scholars employing digital methods encounter a “meaning problem” due to the difficulty of reconciling algorithmic methods with interpretive ones. Conversely, the media scholar Friedrich Kittler has questioned the adequacy of hermeneutics as a means of studying computers. This paper argues that that this disconnect results from a set of contingent decisions made in both humanistic and mathematical disciplines in the first half of the nineteenth century that delineated, with implications that continue to resonate in the present day, which aspects of human activity would come to be formalized in algorithms and which would not. I begin with a discussion of Nicolas de Condorcet, who attempted, at the height of the 1789 revolution, to turn algebra into a universal language; his work, I argue, exemplifies the form of algorithmic thinking that existed before the Romantic turn. Next, I discuss William Wordsworth’s arguments about the relationship of poetry and science. While Wordsworth is sometimes viewed as a critic of science, I argue that his polemic is specifically targeted at highly politicized projects like Condorcet’s that sought to supplant existing modes of thought with scientific rationality. Finally, I demonstrate the importance of Romantic thought for George Boole, creator of the logic system that would eventually form the basis of digital electronics. The reason Boole was able to succeed where Condorcet had failed, I argue, was that Romantic notions of culture enabled him to reconcile a mechanical view of mathematical reasoning with an organic view of the development of meaning—a dichotomy that remains a key assumption of computer interfaces in the twenty-first century. },

  abstract = {{The study of media audiences has long been hotly contested regarding their supposed power to construct shared meanings, to mitigate or moderate media influences, or to complete or resist the circuit of culture. Transformations in the media environment add further grounds for contestation over audience activity or passivity, soâ€“called, given the increasing mediation and digitalization of all dimensions of modern societies. Yet despite such persistent contestation, audiences are often taken for granted within communication theory as, implicitly, an invisible and indivisible mass. The article notes that the audience projectâ€”and thus a grounded recognition of significance of ordinary people's collective and individual experiences of living in a digital ageâ€”seemingly must be reasserted for each generation of scholarship, rearticulating their role in relation to each new phase of sociotechnological change and, perhaps most interesting, reflexively rethinking â€œaudiencingâ€ as the very conditions of modernity are globally reconfigured. After reflecting on the possibility that Western audience researchers have come to take for granted the wider context of audiences' lives, the article observes that one benefit of globalization is a renewed necessity for researchers to articulate that which is taken for granted and thus seek ways to reinsert audiences into the wider analysis of the circuit of culture.}},

Pressure groups fell off the Commission’s agenda, in part because members and staff were unable to agree on whether the groups were democratic or antidemocratic forces.

Research topics, theoretical frameworks, methodology, and authorship information were analyzed using 223 articles. Results indicate that internal communication research in public relations scholarships has exponentially increased since 2011. Research topics on internal communication have diversified since 2000, from descriptive studies illustrating internal communication practices to a variety of relevant phenomena on employee and organizational outcomes. Public relations theories, such as organization–public relationship and symmetrical communication, have been frequently applied in internal communication research. In terms of methodology and sample, quantitative and qualitative methods have been equally utilized, and employees from multiple organizations were frequently used as a type of sample in a large portion of research works. The most productive researchers and institutions of internal communication research in public relations were also identified. Implications for ongoing internal communication research in public relations disciplines are discussed. To address the limitations of the current study, future studies should incorporate an interdisciplinary and a global perspective.},

  abstract = {Comparative studies of journalism have gained considerable currency in recent years, and are often considered to be at the cutting edge of journalism studies. Yet, there has been relatively little systematic examination of the growth of comparative journalism studies or in-depth analysis of the power relations within the field in relation to, for example, trends in authorship or dominant methodologies and paradigms. This article reports the results of a systematic review of comparative studies of journalism published between 2000 and 2015, a key growth period for the field. By examining in detail a population of 441 articles published in 22 key journals, we demonstrate that comparative journalism studies is a dynamic field that has developed considerable structure over time, and outline some key patterns, such as a continuing focus on Western authorship, the study of Western countries and elite media, quantitative methods of analysis and political aspects of journalism. },

It advances a historical sociology of knowledge inflected by feminist and postcolonial studies to trace the invention, institutionalization, and changing meanings of rhetorical theory from the late nineteenth century to the present. In the process, it illuminates three structuring patterns: (1) the valorization of European civilization that accompanied U.S. settler colonialism and its manifestation in universities where rhetorical theory materially grounded itself; (2) the gendered production of knowledge within academic institutions, particularly through the masculinization of the postwar university and its shaping of communities of inquiry invested in rhetorical theory; and (3) the power of relevance as a metonym for intellectual, political, and educational initiatives that, beginning in the late 1960s, enlarged rhetorical theory's community of inquiry and range of meanings.},

  abstract = { How to ethically conduct online platform-based research remains an unsettled issue and the source of continued controversy. The Facebook emotional contagion study, in which researchers altered Facebook News Feeds to determine whether exposure to emotional content influences a user’s mood, has been one focal point of these discussions. The intense negative reaction by the media and public came as a surprise to those involved—but what prompted this reaction? We approach the Facebook study as a mediated controversy that reveals disconnects between how scholars, technologists, and the public understand platform-based research. We examine the controversy from the bottom up, analyzing public reactions expressed in comments on news articles. Our analysis reveals fundamental disagreements about what Facebook is and what a user’s relationship to it should be. We argue that these divergent responses emphasize the contextual nature of technology and research ethics, and conclude with a relational and contextual approach to ethical decision-making. },

Common to all of them nowadays is a more or less immediate reference to the British Cultural Studies, whose circulation however has been different across the three national cases, Italy, France, and Germany (together with Austria). Making use of an array of different sources and methods, this chapter tries to identify the commonalities among these reception histories (also in terms of epistemological foundations) without forgetting their peculiarities with respect to their social and political traditions. In all the three national/regional cases we will examine how the disciplinary and epistemological boundaries have been negotiated among different disciplines and (scholarly, political, and ideological) commitments in order to build new objects of research and a different sensitivity to matters of culture.},

It then examines the activist dimension of Stiegler's later writing projects in the context of his work at the Pompidou Centre's Institut de Recherche et d'Innovation of which he is the founding director, and with Ars Industrialis, the association he co-founded to promote a renewed public sphere engagement with key questions of contemporary technocultural becoming.

  abstract = {Research activities related to social informatics (SI) are expanding, even as community fragmentation, topical dispersion, and methodological diversity continue to increase. Specifically, the different understandings of SI in regional communities have strong impacts, and each has a different history, methodological grounding, and often a different thematic focus. The aim of this article is to connect three selected perspectives on SI—intellectual (regional schools of thought), methodological, and thematic—and introduce a comparative framework for understanding SI that includes all known approaches. Thus, the article draws from a thematic and methodological grounding of research across schools of thought, along with definitions that rely on the extension and intension of the notion of SI. The article is built on a paralogy of views and pluralism typical of postmodern science. Because SI is forced to continually reform its research focus, due to the rapid development of information and communication technology, social changes and ideologies that surround computerization and informatization, the presented perspective maintains a high degree of flexibility, without the need to constantly redefine the boundaries, as is typical in modern science. This approach may support further developments in promoting and understanding SI worldwide.},

  abstract = {Academic interest in what has been termed “infotainment” has grown considerably since the term was coined in the 1980s. Today, the burgeoning field of infotainment research has become an important interdisciplinary field of study producing numerous political, cultural, and social insights. Nevertheless, infotainment remains highly contested, multifaceted, and incoherent, both as a term and a field of study. Preliminary attempts have been made to give greater conceptual clarity and standardization to the term, although their success has been limited, leaving difficulties in analyzing and comparing findings in a unified manner. In this review essay I outline the findings from a comprehensive literature review by delineating three mains trajectories of infotainment research: (1) research on soft news programming; (2) research on traditional news media; and (3) research on media systems and global infotainment. To conclude, I offer three suggestions for future infotainment research, arguing that scholars should attempt to achieve standardization and conceptual clarity within, rather than across research trajectories, that political theory should be more explicitly incorporated into the literature for the purposes of standardizing methods and clarifying normative debates, and that research should also focus on the synergies between contemporary trends in political campaign/communications strategies and trends in infotainment. },

  abstract = {{This article details the brief collaboration between Siegfried Kracauer and Gregory Bateson in the Film Library of the Museum of Modern Art during World War II as an intriguing episode in intellectual history, touching on film and media studies, anthropology, and German studies. The article presents the Frankfurt School as part of the 1940s’ memorandum culture and thereby attempts to situate the historiography of critical theory during this formative period within a broader intellectual landscape, that is, in dialogue and competition with several other projects, to analyze the Nazi German enemy, in this case, the Culture and Personality School. The article takes Kracauer’s and Bateson’s analyses of the Nazi movie Hitlerjunge Quex as a case in point and, with the help of institutional and biographical contextualization, develops some of their most important methodical innovations and insights into Nazi German propaganda. In particular, the article points to Kracauer’s concept of hypnosis and relates it to Bateson’s media theory.}},

  abstract = {The introduction of critical rhetoric into the discourse of rhetorical studies constituted an important rupture with previous traditions within the field. Emerging out of a complex mix of political, philosophical, and academic trends, critical rhetoric produced significant shifts in the ways in which criticism was understood and practiced. The shifting and transformations did not, however, stop with the term’s introduction in 1989. In this essay, we trace the development of critical rhetoric through three additional phases: the Marxist challenge presented by Dana Cloud; the shift to vernacular discourse in the works of Kent Ono and John Sloop; and the recent development of participatory critical rhetoric in the works of Michael Middleton et al. We pursue this historical tracing to demonstrate the points of rupture and discontinuity by which critical rhetoric has been transformed.},

  abstract = {Purpose– The purpose of this paper is to revisit Russell Belk’s (1988) landmark paper “Possessions and the extended self”. The authors provide a prehistory of related ideas and then examine the controversy it triggered regarding the different paradigms of research in marketing (Cohen, 1989) some 26 years ago. Design/methodology/approach– This paper takes Belk seriously when he argues that his work is a synthesis and extension of prior studies leading to the novel production of the “extended self” concept. Via a close reading of the history of self-constitution, the authors highlight a number of thinkers who were grappling with similar issues now associated in our disciplinary consciousness to the idea of the “extended self”. To assess the contribution of Belk’s work, the authors engage in citation and interpretive analyses. The first analysis compared scholarly citations of Belk (1988) with the top ten most-cited Journal of Consumer Research (JCR) papers published in the same year. The second citation analysis compared Belk (1988) to the top ten most-cited JCR papers in the history of the journal. The authors follow this with an interpretive analysis of Belk’s contribution to consumer research via his 1988 paper. Findings– Belk (1988) had the most citations (N = 934) of any paper published in JCR in 1988. When compared to all papers published in the history of JCR, Belk (1988) leads with the most overall citations. Moreover, Belk (1988) is the most prominent interpretive paper that appeared in JCR and one of the top three, regardless of paradigm. The analysis illustrates diversity in topic and methodology, thus indicating that Belk’s contribution impacted a wide variety of scholars. Interpretive analysis indicates the importance of Belk’s work for subsequently impactful consumer researchers. Originality/value– The authors offer a prehistory of the “extended self” concept by highlighting literature that many consumer researchers will not have explored previously. With citations spanning over three decades, consumer behavior scholars recognize Belk (1988) as an important paper. Our analysis reveals that contrary to received wisdom, it is not only important for interpretive researchers or scholars within the consumer culture theory, but it is significant for the entire discipline, irrespective of paradigmatic orientation. The research presented here demonstrates that Belk’s (1988) paper is arguably one of the most influential papers ever published in JCR.},

Rather, his writings and personal letters show how Adorno saw his time in California, the hothouse of the West’s most advanced culture industry, as an opportunity to scrutinize the modern condition. For Adorno, however, this did not have to be a bleak business. Instead, rigorous critique the way Adorno understood it did not mean to put the joys of life on hold and sideline the project of liberation but, on the contrary, to advance it by asserting its emancipatory promise that only pleasure can sustain. },

  abstract = {In his book City of Quartz from 1990, the urban theorist Mike Davis criticized Bertolt Brecht for having failed to explore the “real-life Mahagonny” and “thriving local labor movement” of Los Angeles while he lived there from 1941 to 1947. For someone who considered himself a dialectical thinker, Brecht showed surprisingly little interest in the specific historical dialectic that had shaped Los Angeles. Shortly after moving there, he had already accepted the myth of the “City of Angels” as a hellish materialization of advanced capitalism. The purpose of this essay, which mostly draws upon Brecht’s journal entries, is not to refute Davis’s assessment but to take a closer look at Brecht’s preconceptions and perceptions of American culture and politics to better grasp why he largely ignored, or refused to engage with, the politically progressive developments and working-class movement in a place where he spent six years of his life. },

  abstract = {Two claims are at stake for a science of communication. This essay brings into focus the philosophical distinctions between the human science of communication and the social science of communication. Social science is argued to be the dominant paradigm in mainstream communication inquiry in the United States. Its underlying basis is information theory. Communicology is a human science that differs from social science in that it focuses not on the message but rather the cultural-semiotic constraints on embodied phenomenological experience. This is a unique human science approach. The grounds for comparison are located in the history of these contrasting views and in their problematic concerns. American pragmatism and social psychology are depicted as analogous to European philosophy and the Geisteswissenschaften. As this essay argues, the human science of embodied discourse is historically rooted in semiotics and phenomenology and lead to a synthesis in contemporary communicology. Communicology is distinguished from cultural studies, and a vision for the future discipline is advanced. },

We have ranged across the humanities and social sciences to review the very best scholarship that these domains have produced which speaks to issues likely to concern the readers of the Journal of Marketing Management (JMM). These domains include: the history of marketing management, history of market research, history of market segmentation, product management history, retailing and channels history, promotion history, advertising history, the history of marketing thought, and marketing and the management of subjectivity, among others. Given obvious page limitations we have nevertheless tried to appeal to the paradigmatic span of the readers of the JMM. With this in mind, we have critically reviewed material that will be of interest to managerially oriented academics, as well as those who subscribe to consumer culture theoretics and critical marketing studies. },

@article{plotkindf,
  abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this essay is to argue that, for Veblen, the contribution of advertising to mature business enterprise was crucial. Although Thorstein Veblen’s Theory of the Leisure Class is widely credited with introducing the concept of “conspicuous consumption”, that book is silent on the contribution of the sales effort – or advertising – to such consumption. One must turn to Veblen’s later writings on the business system to find an analysis of advertising within oligopoly capitalism, what Veblen called the system of “absentee ownership”. At the beginning of the twentieth century business faced looming threats of technological progress and democratic discontent. The material prospect of accelerating productivity might soon “end the struggle or lessen the strain” of economic life; democracy might insist that the industrial system serve social needs in efficient ways. To ward off such challenges, business developed a two-prong approach to perpetuate scarcity: carefully managed control of output and an increasingly insistent, rationalized and expensive sales effort. The growth of advertising reflected a systematic expenditure of energy, talent and resources on a misdirection of human effort, one whose chief effect was to prolong “the strain” of everyday life in futile pursuit of waste. Whether such irrationality could be sustained indefinitely, or whether it might finally undermine the society that propels its pursuit, is an issue that Veblen raises, but to which he refuses to give any final answer. Design/methodology/approach – The paper analyzes the full range of Veblen’s theoretical writings on consumption, technology and the sales effort. Findings – The paper insists that Veblen is the first radical political economist to provide a systematic critical analysis of advertising as an essential element of mature capitalism. Originality/value – The paper connects Veblen’s earliest thinking on “conspicuous consumption” to his mature analysis of advertising in the functioning of business enterprise. It will enrich understanding among academics and students, scholars of marketing and economic and social theorists, of Veblen’s critical analysis of the evolution of consumption, production and business enterprise.},

Schutz laid stress on the We-relationship resulting from face-to-face performance of music, in which every listener participates with the other listeners, the performers, and the composers. Becker emphasized the existence of taken-for-granted conventions on which cooperative relations between performers are based, in conjunction with other members of the music subcommunity with whom they are engaged in a communication flow. The involved actors may participate in several reciprocally connected worlds of shared experiences, which if jointly considered constitute the art world. The theoretical and conceptual differences between Schutz and Becker, which concern their sociological writings on music, are related to analogous diversities between Phenomenological Sociology and Symbolic Interactionism. Finally, Weber, Honigsheim, and Adorno’s contributions to the sociology of music have been here considered for comparative purposes. },

  abstract = {Background Marshall McLuhan was not only a prolifc reader but also an expert annotator of his own books. Taking as a case study McLuhan's copies of James Joyce's Ulysses in the Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library at the University of Toronto, this article asks what we can learn about McLuhan's reading from close analysis of his own books. Analysis The article begins with a discussion of McLuhan's media theory as "applied Joyce, " with particular reference to Ulysses, and then turns to an overview of the annotation techniques and strategies visible in McLuhan's copies of the novel. Conclusion and implications The conclusion considers McLuhan's own books as hybrid artifacts that challenge us to rethink rigid distinctions between print and manuscript cultures. },

  abstract = {This study systematically analyzes Engineering of Consent (EOC)-focused scholarly papers published between 1947 and 2018 using content analysis and text mining. It aims to shed light on the progress of EOC research and related disciplines as well as the methodologies, data collection methods, major perspectives, and most frequent words used within these writings. Additionally, this study considers publications by region and the affiliations of first authors. The results show that only a small number of EOC-focused papers have been published since 1947; this area of public relations research has suffered from a lack of scholarly attention despite its relevance to various disciplines, and this is a situation that we hope improves. Recent trends have shown some reasons for optimism. We found that at least one EOC-focused paper has been published annually in most years since 2000 (the exceptions are 2001, 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2015). Our research shows that scholars in the fields of public relations, media studies, and political science published more papers on EOC than scholars in other fields. Research articles usually utilize qualitative research methodologies. Interviews stand out as the most widely used data collection method. Our analysis of publications by region and first-author affiliation shows that the majority of EOC papers were written by faculty and students working or studying in the United States. Seven perspectives frequently discussed by scholars and the most frequently used words within EOC papers are highlighted in a follow-up qualitative review.},

  abstract = {This paper draws on broadcast transcripts created by multilingual BBC monitors during the Second World War—which have received little scholarly attention—to consider how conflicting political discourses in wartime India were configured through the airwaves. As both Allied and Axis propaganda vied for the ‘hearts and minds’ of Indian audiences, how did the subcontinent become a geopolitical hotspot, particularly in 1942 with the threat of Japanese invasion, launch of the anticolonial Quit India movement and Subhas Chandra Bose’s nationalist broadcasts from pirate radio stations in Germany? This paper is interested in uncovering how the Indian listener would have ‘tuned in’, along with understanding monitors’ agency in selecting, editing, translating and transcribing these India-oriented transmissions. It seeks to broaden the frames of reference of broadcast history by focusing on non-European/non-US wartime listenership and surveillance, and argues for the value of BBC monitoring transcripts in interrogating the complex relationship between Indian decolonisation and war. },

  abstract = {Following the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940, a Dutch government in exile was set up in London. One of the most important activities of these exiles was to make propaganda against the Nazi’s and throughout the war they operated Radio Oranje (Radio Orange), a wireless station that broadcasted to the Netherlands using BBC-transmitters. Another part of the Dutch broadcasting outfit in England was a ‘listening service’ that made daily reports about Dutch-language radio broadcasts from Hilversum by the Nazi regime. This article draws from a complete, and previously unused, set of these monitoring reports to analyse the Dutch propaganda war in the ether. The source material reveals that notions of Dutch neutrality were central to the radio broadcasts at both sides of the North Sea. In addition, the reports show how the London broadcasters singled out and targeted specific Nazi propagandists whom they thought to be the most dangerous. },

This special issue titled Ferments in the Field: The Past, Present and Future of Communication Studies presents 20 articles, plus this introduction, with the intention to assess the field and provoke discussions about the status of communication studies.

As part of an ongoing movement to decenter White masculinity as the normative core of scholarly inquiry, this paper is meant as a preliminary intervention. By coding and analyzing the racial composition of primary authors of both articles and citations in journals between 1990–2016, we find that non-White scholars continue to be underrepresented in publication rates, citation rates, and editorial positions in communication studies. We offer some analysis as to why these findings matter in our current political moment, and propose steps the field might take towards further documenting and rectifying race and representation in the production of disciplinary knowledge.}},

The assumption of interdisciplinarity is also questioned, as primary journal contributors were limited to a small set of sub-disciplines. The results also reveal a dominance of the (post-)positivistic paradigm and quantitative methods. While the relative proportion of atheoretical research is decreasing, there is also a remarkable slowdown in new theory development. Finally, with a steep decline in federal funding, communication scholars are becoming more reliant on universities, public organizations, and private donors.}},

An American term, it indexed and communicatively advanced the problematization of media that took shape from the 1920s onward. Recently, scholars have debated the term’s continued relevance, typically without awareness of its history or international contexts of use. To provide needed background and enrich efforts to globalize the field, we offer a transnational history of mass communication, illuminating the sociological, cultural, and geopolitical dynamics of its emergence, dissemination, and reception. Mapping locations of its adoption, adaption, and rejection across world regions, we offer a methodology and a historical narrative to shed light on the early globalization of the field and lines of power and resistance that shaped it. We show how the term carries a residue of postwar American hegemony, and argue for greater reflexive awareness of our vocabularies of inquiry.}},

  abstract = {{Within New German Critique’s long-standing commitment to analyzing German-language thought, literature, politics, and culture, film has played an integral role.1 At crucial points in its history, the journal has taken stock of contemporary German cinema, first doing so in a special issue devoted to New German Cinema (Fall–Winter 1981–82). That issue probed the impact of this internationally acclaimed new wave at the zenith of its success. At a time of widespread enthusiasm for this countercinema, the editors expressed concerns about the ways in which many American critical treatments of recent West German cinema had “misread, ignored or distorted its place within the long range history and present context of the German Federal Republic.” By and large, these analyses, however well intentioned, focused on textual idiosyncrasies and gave short shrift to contextual determinants; for that reason they failed “to connect the aesthetics of contemporary filmmaking to the political and social traditions emerging from the Weimar and fascist periods” and to the production of culture within the West German public sphere.2}},

We begin with analysis of bibliographic data to establish the field’s institutional boundaries by highlighting trends in scholarship over time and identifying prominent disciplines and journals. We then sketch the field’s conceptual boundaries by analyzing the concepts and topics that appear most in the literature.

  abstract = {The Eurovision Song Contest is an annual international competition held by the European Broadcasting Union. The present article provides an updated review of the academic literature devoted to the study of the Eurovision Song Contest which in the past two decades developed into a serious and rich academic field with four main areas: (1) studies of imagining a unified Europe – wherein I review research devoted to cosmopolitan European visions and nation branding; (2) studies focusing on gender and what is often referenced as gay or ‘camp’ features in the Eurovision Song Contest; (3) studies of Euro-Divisions which focus on political bloc voting and cultural alliances – exposing consistent and persistent rifts and coalitions in the celebration of European unity; and (4) studies making use of Eurovision data as a cultural seismograph for explaining external phenomenon like economic trade and political conflicts. Two decades of study of the Eurovision reveal that the ideal of unity is persistently challenged by national and cultural commitments. While commentators often deem the Eurovision Song Contest to be a silly kitsch show of musical mediocrity, this review proves it to be an appealing and productive area for the serious study of European civilization and its discontents. },

A decade later, what hath such research wrought? In the broad study of news and its digital transformation, few topics have captivated researchers quite like social media, with hundreds of studies on everything from how journalists use Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and Snapchat to how such platforms facilitate various forms of engagement between journalists and audiences. Now, some 10 years into journalism studies on social media, we need a more particular accounting of the assumptions, biases, and blind spots that have crept into this line of research. Our purpose is to provoke reflection and chart a path for future research by critiquing themes of what has come before. In particular, our goal is to untangle three faulty assumptions—often implicit but no less influential—that have been overlooked in the rapid take-up of social media as a key phenomenon for journalism studies: (1) that social media would be a net positive; (2) that social media reflects reality; and (3) that social media matters over and above other factors.},

  abstract = {This paper revisits the intellectual development of cultural studies in Latin America in order to assess current challenges and identify lines of research. It is argued that much of the literature has failed to seriously consider key points of cultural studies, namely, the need to be critical about its own epistemological premises and the need to study culture within broad social formations. Since the landmark studies by N{\'e}stor Garc{\'i}a Canclini and Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero laid the foundations in the 1980s, the field of cultural studies has generally aimed to illustrate original arguments instead of using them as a point of departure to analyze media and cultural phenomena. Consequently, many scholars have produced work that while it proves and illustrates original arguments about the hybrid nature of cultures and the complexity of cultural mediation, it does not push the field in new theoretical directions. An additional problem is that, often, the study of culture has been divorced from a close inspection of the linkages between cultural, political, and economic processes, and from the articulations between high and low culture. Consequently, the political underpinnings of the enterprise of cultural studies, as outlined by Raymond Williams and Stuart Hall, have been in the background. This choice has, arguably, restrained the intellectual development and undermined the potential to move theory-building and the debate forward. Additionally, the disinterest in critically exploring theoretical premises has diminished the potential to transcend the boundaries of '' area studies'' in order to engage with the study of media and culture as well as cultural studies globally. The paper concludes by suggesting research directions that might contribute to overcoming the current intellectual impasse.},

  abstract = {This study examines the graduate training and research styles of some of Kurt Lewin's intellectual descendents. Specifically the question addressed was: What aspects of the social psychological environment at the Research Center for Group Dynamics while it was at MIT (1945-1948), enabled certain gifted students to develop the skills, enthusiasm and self-permission to be productive later in their careers and in turn, to foster younger scientists to do the same? Those aspect of Lewin's training which may have been responsible for the creative productivity of his intellectual descendents are the focus of this inquiry. These include the influence of Lewin's theory, the experimental method he brought to complex social phenomena as well as his personal style and approach to psychology. Twenty in-depth interviews were carried out and make up an oral history of the graduate training of some of Lewin's descendents. Those interviewed included three faculty members and six social psychologists who were graduate students at the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT. Also interviewed were eight social psychologists who were trained by members of the original MIT group, two social psychologists who were trained by one of the second generation Lewinians, and one social psychologist with close ties to the group. Some of the aspects of Lewin's training environment which were handed down by his students include: Immediate immersion in research with little emphasis on course work, an interdependent working style in which problem-solving research meetings known as the Quasselstrippe played a key part, task centeredness, intense scrutiny of data, self identification as scientists and use of an apprenticeship method of training. One model of graduate training is to purposefully train students in the art of scientific investigation in order to produce quality researchers. Another model, one followed by some members of the Lewin group, involves selecting the best students and carefully supervising them in order to produce quality research. Beginning with Lewin himself, training students has been a by-product of the pursuit of scientific understanding.},

  abstract = {Politicians, Government Officials, and Public Relations Officers Lean heavily on polling when fashioning public policy. Proponents say this is for the best, arguing that surveys bring the views of citizens closer to civic officials. Critics decry polling's promotion of sycophantic politicians who pander to the whims of public sentiment or conversely, the use of surveys by special interests to thwart the majority will. claims and criticisms were made during the early days of polling. When George Gallup began polling Americans in 1935, he heralded it as a bold step in popular democrat: The views of ordinary citizens could now be heard alongside those of organized interest groups. When brought to Canada in 1941, the Gallup Poll promised similar democratic rejuvenation. In actual practice, traditionally disadvantaged constituencies such as women, the poor, French Canadians in Canada, and African Americans in the United States were often heavily under-represented in Gallup surveys. Preoccupied with election forecasting, Gallup pollsters under-counted social groups thought less likely or unable to vote, leading to a considerable gap between the sampled polity and the general public. Examining the origins and early years of public opinion polling in Canada, Robinson situates polling within the larger context of its forerunners \textendash{} market research surveys and American opinion polling \textendash{} and charts its growth until its first uses by political parties.},

  abstract = {Since the late 1990s, media literacy has become an increasingly prominent paradigm within the fields of media and communication studies in the United States and elsewhere. This article investigates the convergence of forces in that propelled this approach to its currently ascendant position. With a nod to Harvey J. Graff's analysis of the mythic power associated with the concept of literacy, the article explores the techniques and rationales that have coalesced around media literacy, making it at once central to the operation of neoliberal capitalism and to its critique. Putting media literacy into a longer history of the instrumental and biopolitical use of media in education and considering the role of education in connecting children's interests to moral and economic regulation, media literacy is taken to be the most recent iteration of a long-standing set of ideas that have been taken up in different ways by early educational reformers, postwar development communications theorists, and countercultural media educators.},

  abstract = {The major developments of mass communication research, particularly in Britain, during the last fifteen years are reviewed critically. A new revisionist movement has emerged that challenges the dominant radical paradigms of the late 1970s and early 1980s. This has taken the form of contesting the underlying models of society, the characterization of media organizations, the representations of media content, the conception of the audience and the aesthetic judgements that underpinned much `critical' research. The author argues that this revisionism is in part a reversion to certain discredited conventional wisdoms of the past, a revivalism masquerading as new and innovatory thought. However, part of the new critique can be seen as a reformulation that could potentially strengthen the radical tradition of communications research.},

From this perspective it becomes important that we explore how marketing theory comes to be ordered in the way it presently is, and the manner in which certain ideas develop or face extinction, in order to better understand what can or cannot be said in market- ing theory. In response, this article argues that a much needed turn in the paradigm debate should be toward the exploration of the institutionalization of marketing theory. It examines the social, economic and institutional logic underpinning theory production in marketing and demonstrates the influence of McCarthyism and the Cold War climate on marketing theory.},

The data come from four main sources: (1) a survey conducted among Latin American scholars (N = 50), to determine their opinions about the origins, growth, and present state of communication research in the region; (2) a survey conducted among U.S. scholars with experience in Latin America (N = 51), to determine the same information as above but from a point of view that we suspect is somewhat different from that within the region; (3) a citation analysis of the main communication journals to determine the different intellectual influences on Latin American communication scholars; and (4) a content analysis of research published in seven major English language communication journals, and ten major Latin American journals to determine the main topics studied by each group of scholars. Structurally, this dissertation has seven parts. Chapter I introduces the topic and discusses the purpose, central research questions, and research methods. Chapter II deals with the way in which the different research traditions have grown in the region, as well as with the characteristics of the various studies conducted so far on the growth of communication research in Latin America. Chapter III describes the various methods of data collection and data analysis used in the present study. Chapters IV through VI present the major research findings regarding the following issues: (1) stages of development of communication research in Latin America, internal and external factors that determined the emergence of the discipline in the region, its milestones, and major changes over time; (2) major Latin American communication journals and research topics, most influential authors, and countries where research has been conducted; (3) main obstacles to communication research in Latin America, present state of the discipline, and expected changes for the near future. Finally, Chapter VII discusses the results at length, summarizes the main findings, considers some practical and theoretical implications of the study, and suggests further research.},

It analyzes the relationships between major scholarship on alternative media and various historical contexts in order to discover various conceptions' limitations and possibilities. The value of such a study is not only how it recovers the variety of ways in which alternative media have been thought. By doing so, it also reminds readers of the necessary relation between theoretical conceptions and historical conditions remarked on by scholars. Such a study also reminds of the contingency of conceptions today, which typically emphasize separately or in combination (a) a kind of content, (b) a means of funding, or (c) the use of new technologies. The article begins by tracing the emergence and development of a dominant interpretive theory based in vanguardism, essentialism, and technological determinism, and concludes by discussing recent efforts that are grounded in materialist theories of culture and society. Such a change signals an ongoing project of generating understandings of alternative media that suggest the reciprocal relationships between modes of production, media forms, and oppositional, participatory practice.},

Over this time period, the desire for consumer products becomes figured by industry observers and researchers as a mode of children's "self expression."

  abstract = {Personal Influence is not only a landmark study within the sociological literature on networks, influence, and decision making. It is also an allegory of Jewish-ethnic identity in mid-twentieth-century America and a side-ways commentary on modern Jewish involvement in communications. The book participates in a utopian imagination of society in which Jews and Gentiles alike would be centrally involved in the flow of communications. It turns from Gentile-style status toward Jewish-style connectivity as the basis of social power; defends socially grounded conceptions of mental life against Gentile individualism; insists in its notion of the two-step flow on the rabbinic principle that a text without a commentary is meaningless; and performs some amazing intellectual-moral-historical footwork with the most inconspicuous of all its central terms, '' people.'' In all these things, it can be read as a '' Jewish'' text in some sense.},

AJC scholarship has shown its Asian uniqueness by exploring social and cultural comparisons focusing on a few East Asian countries. It has also followed Western communication scholarship by investigating effects of political communication and news media, as well as advertising using television in the United States, similar to JMCQ. AJC contributes to mainstream mass communication scholarship while keeping its own Asian perspectives.},

  abstract = {The subject of this article is the emigration of German-speaking communication researchers after 1933 to the US and other countries. The article focuses on Zeitungswissenschaft (newspaper studies) in Weimar Germany and its lost works. Lost, because some of the most brilliant protagonists of this new academic field, which was first established in 1918 at the University of Leipzig, were refugees from Nazi Germany. Often, they were not able to enter an international setting of communication science due to the ruptures in their lives and careers. Their books have not been translated. These theoretical approaches were mainly of sociological impact and far from simple stimulus-response models. The Third Reich, with its aims of propaganda and lack of scientific relevance in the field, marked an end-point to a very innovative process-oriented way of thinking in early communication science in Germany. Most of the protagonists of this new thinking emigrated: for example, the sociologists Karl Mannheim and Ernest Manheim, the communication researchers Walter Auerbach and Gerhard M{\"u}nzner. This article outlines the theoretical background of early communication science in Germany and the context of racist and political persecution and emigration as a social and intellectual breakdown of this science. Actually, this breakdown gains new interest in the German academic community; the past of German communication science and its very dark sides have become topics of discussion and research.},

  abstract = {This article examines the intellectual history of the concept of 'publicity', originally defined by Immanuel Kant as the transcendental formula of public justice and the principle of the public use of reason, but later largely subsumed under the concept of 'freedom of the press'. The notion of the press as the Fourth Estate/Power was a valid concept and legitimate form of the institutionalization of the principle of publicity in the period when newspapers emanated from a new (bourgeois) estate or class: they had a different source of legitimacy than the three classic powers, and developed as a critical impulse against the old ruling estates. Yet the discrimination in favor of the power/control function of the press, which relates to the need of 'distrustful surveillance' defended by Bentham, clearly abstracted freedom of the press from the Kantian quest for the public use of reason. In democratic societies where the people rather than different estates legitimize all the powers, the control dimension of publicity embodied in the corporate freedom of the press should be effectively supplemented by actions toward equalizing private citizens in the public use of reason.},

Through comparative analyses of Bal{\'a}zs with the racial physiognomist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss as well as with Bal{\'a}zs's fellow Marxist Walter Benjamin, this article outlines key aspects of both right-wing and left-wing physiognomics. While Bal{\'a}zs did share with reactionary physiognomists the problematic idealist tendency to view the body as materialized soul, his views on physiognomy evaded racial essentialism, as he promoted cinematic physiognomics as a way to overcome boundaries of race and nation. Furthermore, Bal{\'a}zs and Benjamin used physiognomic perception to reconfigure social hierarchies and the relationship of spectators to technology and the material world, thus converting potentially reactionary concepts into ones that could be made serviceable for Marxism.},

  abstract = {The scientific pollsters (Archibald Crossley, George H. Gallup, and Elmo Roper) emerged onto the American news media scene in 1935. Much of what they did in the following years (1935\textendash{}1948) was to promote both the political and scientific legitimacy of their enterprise. They sought to be recognized as the sole legitimate producers of public opinion. In this essay I examine the, mostly overlooked, rhetorical work deployed by the pollsters to publicize the scientific credentials of their polling activities, and the central role the concept of sampling has had in that pursuit. First, they distanced themselves from the failed straw poll by claiming that their sampling methodology based on quotas was informed by science. Second, although in practice they did not use random sampling, they relied on it rhetorically to derive the symbolic benefits of being associated with the '' laws of probability.''},

  abstract = {The authors examine two classic research studies from the 1950s: David Manning White's analysis of the "gatekeeper" news editor and Warren Breed's explanation of social control in the newsroom. Although posing a potentially radical question- "What makes news?"-these efforts were largely absorbed into and reinforced the limited media effects paradigm of the time. Drawing from interviews with the authors, the authors of this article trace the origin, impact, and intellectual context of these forerunners of media sociology. The authors argue that although these two studies were exceptions to the field's preoccupation with audience and effects, they nevertheless accepted and implicitly reinforced the prevailing media framework built around the commercial publishing and broadcasting industries. As such, they resemble much of the field's research, grounded as it has been in the "limited effects" reinforcement perspective of Lazarsfeld and the broader functionalist tradition of Merton. By calling the news construction process into question, both studies presented potential challenges to the "taken for granted" nature of the media.},

  abstract = {In this article, we trace the emergence of film criticism in Australia, from the period of its first appearance in the 1920s to its formalisation in the academy in the 1970s. Through an examination of trade, fan, newspaper and journal publications, we identify along the way four significant moments when broader industrial, public and institutional configurations gave rise to different kinds of film criticism: an 'independent commentary moment' (the 1920s), a 'film as film moment' (1930s), a 'film appreciation moment' (1950s\textendash{}1960s) and a 'production principle moment' (1970s). Each attended to some new way of taking up and being with film and is associated with its own particular array of practices. This historical trajectory of film criticism was characterised by increasing complexity and variety. Rather than replacing or displacing existing forms, each new form of film criticism built upon existing forms, produced new layerings and relations among critical forms. Using Bennett's [Making Culture, Changing Society (Abingdon, 2013), 125.] perspectives on the relation between culture and government, we identify film criticism as a form of expertise for adjudicating films and guiding their uptake. In this way, we show film criticism as being shaped not only by the shifting priorities of film and the film world, but also by broader contingencies of media, education and public culture. This lens reveals an important Australian difference when compared to the US, Britain and continental Europe: the Australian uptake of a film-as-film aesthetics in longer form film writing and reviewing is very much a response to and a consequence of the coming of sound rather than of the late silent period. We end with some remarks on the contribution this national trajectory of film reviewing made to the formation of film writing in the Australian academy and to the revival of Australian film-making, which both began in earnest in the 1970s.},

Its ancestry includes philosophers and social scientists who contributed to the definition of public opinion, which had to be conceptualized before it could be measured. Landowners and social reformers are among those who worked on the methods of social surveys. Journalists, psychologists, and sociologists contributed to the fashioning of questionnaires. Sampling theory was developed by astronomers, mathematicians, and economists, while the methods of data analysis were devised by statisticians, psychologists, and sociologists. All this, when coupled with modern technology, makes polling an indispensable tool of politics, business, and the mass media today.},

@phdthesis{gordon_genesis_1987,
  abstract = {The principal aim of this study is to offer an historical reconstruction of the genesis of radical cultural studies. In practice this project has entailed the construction of a progressively-written account of the intellectual development of the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies from the time of its establishment in 1964 and, especially, during the period of the politicisation of its project from the historical conjuncture of 1968 onwards through to the mid-1970s. Integral to the realising of this aim has been the development of an interpretation of the Centre's radical project as having constituted a counter-intellectual critique; that is, and interrelated ensemble of delegitimating, legitimating and reflexive critiques. It will be shown that this interpretation emerges from the Centre's intellectual history over the periods of its development considered and that, in retrospect, it can be discerned in the terms in which the Centre critically transformed its own project. The study begins with a critical consideration of two reconstructive approaches to cultural studies\textendash{}those of historical reconstruction and reconstructive critique. After this point of departure attention is immediately focussed on the originating formulation and the initial reception of the Birmingham Centre's project. This is followed by a chapter devoted to the critical practice of its founder Richard Hoggart. Two chapters on the Centre's engagement with sociology then ensue and this leads to a consideration of the radicalisation of its project which emphasises the turn towards Marxism that it involved. Next the elements of a reconstructive critique of radical cultural studies are presented using the components of a counter-intellectual critique theoretically constructed for this purpose conjoined with a perspective on three kinds of knowledge-constitutive interests. A brief discussion on the derivation and use of the term counter culture is also given. Lastly the study reconsiders reconstructive approaches to cultural studies with special reference to the topic of deep interpretation. The study ends with some reflections on cultural studies and its 'shadow'.},

Past my detailed explication of Luhmann?s key concepts, I register my deep disagreements with his philosophy and speculate about why his treatise may have suffered neglect within EC. Briefly mentioning critical traditionalism, I also suggest alternatives to Luhmann?s theoretical framework. I devote the last section of the paper to my vision for the future of EC.},

  abstract = {The division of the communication discipline according to whether people communicate face-to-face or via a technological medium has shaped the field's development from the outset. The divide has been institutionalized over time in the structures of academic departments and schools, professional training and degrees, scholarly societies and publishing, and in the field's larger research agendas. However, critics inside and outside the field have long insisted that the differences between the two subfields actually obscure the shifting, contingent nature of communication in everyday experience, social formations, and culture. This paper traces efforts to theorize the intersection of interpersonal and media communication, and in particular the concept of mediation, from Lazarsfeld and Katz's two-step flow in the 1950s, to the challenge of digital media technologies in the 1970s and 1980s, to the rise of new media studies and digital culture scholarship from the 1990s onward.},

The five primary findings reveal that: 1) publication of new media research continues to diffuse, with the subfield likely to have reached a critical mass and passed through an adoption 'take off' phase; 2) authors favor a concentrated set of title keyword terms to describe their research; 3) media-oriented journals publish approximately half of all new media articles; 4) a core set of 14 communication-related journals currently publishes new media research; and 5) the principles of mediamorphosis and diffusion of innovations help to explain the emergence of the new media concentration within the communication discipline. We conclude that new media research focusing on the internet and related digital technologies is currently a formalized and self-sustaining area of study within the discipline.},

The paper addresses this convergence-within-divergence by comparing how policy discourses have conceptualised popular culture in the two countries. It investigates the hypothesis that, in both, an engagement with popular culture has in fact been an important driver of change, albeit at different times and with different taxonomies.

The social policy focus of mass communication research, the high level of public concern over media effects, a variety of methodological cleavages, and different cognate field referents are cited as forces that support segregation of the two research areas. The recent turn to cognitive explanations of communication in both of these domains may create the climate necessary for meaningful collaboration between researchers.},

The stark contrast between superficially similar scenes in Goethe's Werther and Dante's Divine Comedy, each of which is said to represent fundamentally different conceptualizations of authorship and love, is a revealing instance of Kittler's distinctive and polemical appropriation of French post-structuralism as well as of his subsequent switch from discourse analysis to media theory. Ultimately, 'Authorship and Love' even points ahead to Kittler's final work on music and mimesis in ancient Greece.},

Ong is most widely known for his orality\textendash{}literacy scholarship, we do well to bear in mind that his most advanced formal training was in literary studies. From early on in these studies, the figure he wrote about and continued to write about throughout his life was the poet, and fellow Jesuit, Gerard Manley Hopkins. Ong was drawn to Hopkins in large part for the bearing of his writing on the evolution of human consciousness. Ong discovered in his Master's thesis on Hopkins' sprung rhythm \textendash{} written under Marshall McLuhan \textendash{} that Hopkins was in some sense hearing in advance the sounds of what would become twentieth-century modernism. Hopkins displayed a sensibility and awareness that were compelling for the modernist writers of the twentieth century, as they carried out their experiments with finding new voices, new ways of writing poetry for the changed world in which they found themselves. Hopkins' feel for the distinctive self, seeking connection with other selves in the uncertainties of time, played no small role in this appeal. Ong's work on Hopkins is a model for both literary criticism and studies in the evolution of consciousness.},

  abstract = {Media archaeological methods for extending the lifetime of new media into 'old media' have experienced a revival during the past years. In recent media theory, a new context for a debate surrounding media archaeology is emerging. So far media archaeology has been articulated together with such a heterogeneous bunch of theorists as Erkki Huhtamo, Siegfried Zielinski, Thomas Elsaesser and to a certain extent Friedrich Kittler. However, debates surrounding media archaeology as a method seem to be taking it forward not only as a subdiscipline of (media) history, but increasingly into what will be introduced as materialist media diagrammatics. This article maps some recent media archaeological waves in German media theory. The text addresses Wolfgang Ernst's mode of media archaeology and his provocative accounts on how to rethink media archaeology as a fresh way of looking into the use and remediation of media history as a material monument instead of a historical narrative and as a recent media theoretical wave from Germany that seems to not only replicate Kittler's huge impact in the field of materialist media studies but develop that in novel directions. However, as will be argued towards the end, Ernst's provocative take that hopes to distinguish itself as a Berlin brand of media theory in its hardware materiality and time-critical focus resonates strongly with some of the recent new directions coming from US media studies, namely in software and platform studies.},

This article provides one observer's perspective on the evolution of the discipline: literature, theory, and practice. The creation and growth of ISAGA are also referenced. Early computer simulations failed at prediction due to limitations of theory, data, and technology. Their lack of transparency limited their value for expository purposes. Through time, a design methodology has emerged to guide the creation of simulation games to improve communication in complex policy decision environments. These instruments are not intended to be predictive; rather, their primary objective is to help a group achieve consensus through the multilogue mode of communication. Several simulation/games are outlined to illustrate the progression of the discipline.},

Both ARCYP and JOCAM emerged during a time of productive intersections between the fields of children's studies and media studies.

These tensions\textemdash{}having to do with notions of textuality and authority, consumption and children's agency and citizenship and power\textemdash{}point to lacunae in the field of children's media studies.

Such was the case in the relationship between the private, voluntary National Film Society of Canada and the public, state-funded National Film Board of Canada. It was a relationship that demonstrated the fragmentary and incomplete nature of hegemonic discourses. The NFS served a crucial function by coordinating access of films to schools and public life, often on behalf of the NFB. Assisting this coordination was an obscure and short-lived organization, the Canadian Film Committee. The CFC and the NFS helped to tilt the idea of national film projects toward an educational discourse, one that highlighted issues of citizenship over other alternatives for national film culture.},

This interest was reactivated in 1959 when he developed a loosely structured research program on the history of social research centered on seminars at both Columbia University and the Sorbonne. He hoped to complement the standard histories of sociology that dwell exclusively on social theory with the history of the other, equally important, empirical roots of the discipline. Lazarsfeld thought that institutional support for social research would be more readily forthcoming if the long and interesting history of empirical sociology became better known.},

Participants understood education within a professional narrative, that is, as offering a way of establishing Australian public relations as a distinct field of expertise and confirming its professional status. The findings offer new insights into the development of Australian public relations education as it became established as a popular course of study and the role of PRIA in the constitution and transmission of public relations knowledge.},

One of the central contradictions of the Decatur Study is that it simultaneously disguises that it is women who are being studied here yet universalizes them as representative of the general population. But the article also argues that despite the blind spots and ahistoricity of Personal Influence, it was a crucial reminder that women, despite being individual targets of much media fare, were also embedded in social networks through which they influenced other women and were, in turn, influenced by them.},

Our analysis identified five relatively independent research traditions addressing this construct.

We conclude with conceptual and operational recommendations for researchers interested in perspective-taking, highlighting potential areas of investigation that communication scholars are uniquely positioned to explore.},

Through that decade many intellectuals who became leaders in Australian Cultural Studies and important players in Cultural Studies outside of Australia worked in Perth. Among them were John Fiske, John Frow, John Hartley, Tom O'Regan, Lesley Stern, Graeme Turner and, a decade later, Ien Ang. This essay discusses the presence of these academics in Perth and advances some reasons why Perth became so important to Cultural Studies in Australia. It also discusses the kind of Cultural Studies that became privileged in Perth and considers some of the reasons for this. Perth Cultural Studies in the 1980s was primarily text-based and focused on screen-related popular culture, especially television programs and popular film. Cultural Studies in Perth developed in a city thought of as marginal to Australia, in institutions that were either not universities or, in the case of Murdoch University, was a very new university, by cosmopolitan academics who mostly came from either elsewhere in Australia or from the United Kingdom.},

We have evaluated the scientific work of Maletzke, biographical material, contemporary witness accounts and protocols of several interviews with Maletzke and some of his peers. The analysis of this material has confirmed the interdependence between the evolution of theories, discipline and the media and the importance of reviewing a scientific study in the context of the biography of its author and the structures of science, which should be applicable to many\textemdash{}local and global\textemdash{}figures in the history of communication science.},

  abstract = {This article presents an analysis of several instances of theorizing across distinct media in the writings of three of the most prominent thinkers in German film theory, B{\'e}la Bal{\'a}zs, Rudolf Arnheim, and Walter Benjamin. Against the common identification of the project of classical film theory with commitment to essentialist notions of medium specificity, the article demonstrates the theorists' concern with intermedial issues of exchanges between film and other media. Drawing on examples from the engagement with the newly emergent medium of radio in canonical texts by the three theorists, the article discusses the influence of radio on theorizing about the unique properties of film, its aesthetic possibilities, and course of development. The article finally argues that the vast dynamic changes in the mediascape of the 1920s and 1930s, which saw the coming of sound film, the emergence of radio, and the first demonstrations of television technology, necessitated classical film theorists to adopt intermedial perspectives similar to those that are commonplace in today's writings on digital cinema and new media.},

Then, on the basis of Mulvey's latest book, Death 24\texttimes{} a Second, and of a variety of contemporary examples, the emphasis is on the relative shift in Mulvey's work from gender to time and visual technology. Finally, the conversation focuses on the concept of 'gendered scopic regime' and the potential re-articulation of the male gaze through the technological re-direction and control of the visual.},

  abstract = {While 'cultural studies is caught in a traffic jam', at the same time the seemingly global crisis of cultural studies coincides with the late reception and high popularity of cultural studies in the German-speaking countries after the 'cultural' and the 'linguistic turns'. Yet, the political and academic history and the contexts of the emergence of cultural studies and 'Kulturwissenschaften', as well as their by now established academic traditions and the manifold relations to current developments, are rarely defined and scrutinized. In this paper,we will relate some theoretical and historical perspectives concerning the relationship between cultural studies and the historical disciplines in the German-speaking context. We shall try to trace the potential of mutual benefits between cultural studies and history by foregrounding the political commitment of academic work that still seems to be one of the most important traits of CS as much as the necessity of a stronger notion of the contextualization that history and historiographical methodology provides.},

At the same time, the globalization of media combined with the globalization of higher education means that the research and teaching of the subject faces immediate and profound challenges, not only as the subject of enquiry but also as the means by which researchers and students undertake their studies.Edited by a leading scholar of global communication, this collection of essays by internationally-acclaimed scholars from around the world aims to stimulate a debate about the imperatives for internationalizing media studies by broadening its remit, including innovative research methodologies, taking account of regional and national specificities and pedagogic necessities warranted by the changing profile of students and researchers and unprecedented growth of media in non-Western world.Transnational in its perspectives, Internationalizing Media Studies is a much-needed guide to the internationalization of media and its study in a global context.},

  abstract = {Deleuze's cinema books are often understood as adopting a Bergsonian framework while rejecting phenomenological accounts of film experience for equating 'cinematographic perception' with 'natural perception'; or, alternatively, simply as being a phenomenological inquiry. Reading Deleuze's comments on, and references to, phenomenology in the cinema books (especially Merleau-Ponty, Laffay, and Dufrenne), this paper argues that while not following a phenomenological logic in general, at certain moments the cinema books' Bergsonian account intersects with phenomenology. Moreover, in the books, the existence of movement-images in the cinema depends on the spectator's experience of watching films. The logic explaining this encounter is indebted to the account of the experience of art and cinema in phenomenology which Deleuze combines with the discussion of 'real' movements in Bergson's Creative Evolution. This reliance on a specific 'passive' viewer's experience can explain the books' limited interest in early cinema and in television, video, and the digital image.},

Carey believed that the university had ceased to be an autonomous institution and, following the lead of the Canadian theorist Harold Innis, argued that its culture had been penetrated by interests representing the state, corporate commitments, and the professions. He said the modern curriculum fosters the formation of experts rather than citizens. The essay concludes with an analysis of how Carey sought to reconnect university education to democratic life and to what he called the '' general moral and intellectual point of view.''},

Walter Thompson ?made sense* from the standpoint of the actors involved. At the time Watson joined the agency, he had achieved a national reputation as a psychologist, a researcher, and the leader of behaviorist psychology. His doctrine, which recognized prediction and control as the goal of psychology, meshed well not only with broader Progressive concerns of social control, but more particularly with the goals of the business community, and at J. Walter Thompson, with the goals of Stanley B. Resor. Watson's presence at the agency became a *mechanism* through which Resor could implement his philosophy into advertising practice. Watson's work was to help rationalize the advertising process, but at the same time, spoke directly to the admirers of science, legitimating a reality in which decision making based upon *scientific* methods assumed a role of prominence.},

As part of the field of Applied Social Sciences, journalism remains popular among the young generation: The demand for undergraduate bachelor's programs has attracted fairly high levels of enrollment in the last three decades. For the purposes of this article, we analyze the application of the 2013 Guidelines for Journalism Education to verify whether bachelor's programs in journalism include or neglect an important axis in the process of instruction: knowledge of the world and the intellectual challenges of journalistic routines, as suggested in the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) Model Curricula for Journalism Education.},

Hall (1959), the American anthropologist who wrote The Silent Language and founded the field of intercultural communication, exchanged over 133 letters during the period between 1962 and 1976. Their correspondence provides insight into the evolution of such important ideas as the conception of the media as extensions of man, media technological determinism, and McLuhan's dictum that the medium is the message. Although these ideas are usually attributed to McLuhan, who wrote about them in two important books, The Gutenberg Galaxy (1962) and Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man (1965), Hall had considerable influence in their development. Although Harold Innis is widely acknowledged for shaping McLuhan as a communication technological determinist, the exchange between Hall and McLuhan helped develop the latter's theory about the impacts of communication technology on the human senses. Here we see how important intellectual ideas often grow out of communication between scholars, allowing them to test and extend their thinking in a collaborative mode.},

Additional topics include scene processing and the E-Z Reader model. Rayner's legacy and the impact he had on students and colleagues are described. Keith Rayner's extraordinary scientific career revolutionized the field of reading research and had a major impact on almost all areas of cognitive psychology. In this article, we review some of his most significant contributions. We begin with Rayner's research on eye movement control, including the development of paradigms for answering questions about the perceptual span and its relationship to attention, reading experience, and linguistic variables. From there we proceed to lexical processing, where we summarize Rayner's work on effects of word frequency, length, predictability, and the resolution of lexical ambiguity. Next, we turn to syntactic and discourse processing, covering the well-known garden-path model of parsing and briefly reviewing studies of pronoun resolution and inferencing. The next section shifts from language to visual cognition and reviews research which makes use of eye movement techniques to investigate object and scene processing. Next, we summarize Rayner and colleagues' approach to computational modeling, with a description of the E-Z Reader model linking attention and lexical processing to eye movement control. The final section discusses the issues Rayner and his colleagues were focused on most recently and considers how Rayner's legacy will continue into the future.},

However, this story occludes other, decidedly undemocratic, foundational ideas that were at the heart of rhetoric and oratory during the first half of the twentieth century. Given contemporary concerns with both deliberative democracy and affect theory, rhetoricians and speech teachers would benefit today from a fuller understanding of some of the undemocratic ideas that influenced the modern rhetorical renaissance. This article helps accomplish this by focusing on the work of Gustave Le Bon, whose concern with persuasion and the masses was influential on early scholars of rhetorical oratory, including James Winans, William Brigance, and James O?Neill. Indeed, it was Gustave Le Bon who popularized the notion that the masses were like a psychological crowd devoid of reason and the ability to deliberate.},

Despite this, a significant proportion of writers who have documented, analysed, and indeed celebrated heavy metal has been women, from the groundbreaking sociological studies of Deena Weinstein and Donna Gaines, to the recent ethnographic work of Emma Baulch. This article provides a preliminary investigation of this historical phenomenon and what it can reveal about the ever complex, constantly changing relationship between gender and power in metal.},

  abstract = {This essay discusses the assumptions that ground radical, liberal, and socialist feminist theoretical frameworks, and reviews and critiques feminist media research. I argue that liberal feminism, which characterizes much U.S. mainstream media research, speaks only to white, heterosexual, middle and upper class women and is incapable of addressing most women's concerns. Radical and structuralist feminist communication scholars, however, tend to focus exclusively on texts and often ignore important contextual considerations. I conclude that socialist feminism offers the greatest potential for a comprehensive framework to address women's devaluation in communication but that much more theoretical and empirical work still needs to be done. Finally, I encourage the recent tendency among feminist communication scholars to ignore disciplinary boundaries and draw freely on literary, film, and speech studies, as well as mass communication and feminist theory.},

This article follows that institutional perspective about communication research in general and critical media studies in particular. First the evolution of the field since the 1950s is reviewed through a number of stages, which coincide with the history of leftist thinking \textendash{} six ferments, one for each decade. Then the disciplinary nature of the field is discussed, with special reference to the ongoing reform of higher education in Europe known as the '' Bologna process.'' An illustrative case is provided by a survey of the field in the Scandinavian countries. The conclusion is that there is a need for radical reflection about the discipline in the contemporary world, calling for an approach to media studies in terms of the philosophy of science. The article presents notes for further thought rather than suggests final scenarios, and this is done from an admittedly personal and national perspective \textendash{} as a veteran of the field and as a member of the Finnish community.},

  abstract = {The work of Erving Goffman has been influential in media studies, primarily via adaptations of selected concepts like ?region? and ?frame.? However, relatively little attention has been paid by media researchers to Goffman's own theoretical work on the mass media. Taking its lead from the later work of Goffman, this essay shows how it contains elements of a theoretical framework for mass-mediated communication, through the concepts of ?hyper-ritualization? and ?dramatic scriptings.? I emphasize the way that Goffman situates mass communication in relation to the interpersonal realm as a model version of the latter, as mass communication is crafted, concentrated, and planned to a degree that interpersonal communication is not. I conclude that Goffman's critical approach to informality in broadcast talk and interaction is a valuable tool for the researcher in a time when the rhetoric of informality has become a dominant mode of legitimation in broadcasting.},

The results reveal a weak academic culture that contrasts with a strong professional culture among the members of this community, but also the influence that both organizational and individual variables have on Chilean JMC educators' orientations. Specifically, the analyses indicated that the level of education, part-time/full-time commitment, and the type of university are the most influential factors in defining both the prevalence of a professional culture and the lack of research productivity. These findings support other international studies, indicating a global tendency across key variables that influence academic development in the field.

In the first part of the essay, I account for the preoccupations of South African cultural studies from the late 1980s to the late 1990s. In the second part, I reflect on further shifts since 2000. Here I argue for a politics of the emergent, an increasing turn towards the negotiation of the possible, the drawing in of trans-national frames, and the reformulation of theories of race in the aftermath of resistance politics. Studies of popular culture during this period increasingly come to be superseded by a focus on public culture and on circulation. The essay concludes by considering current contests in cultural studies in South Africa and with a reflection on its current place within a reconstituted public intellectual space.},

On asking about the problems and issues that researchers had to face in earlier days Crossley said that the problems were considerable because there was almost no marketing information at the time. There were very few books on marketing, and just a few books on advertising. The census data was very limited information in the census and it was out of date at that particular time. There was almost nothing at that time on the number of readers of a magazine or even the number of people that got a magazine. What happened then was that the publishers would issue what they call "publishers' statements of circulation." The trouble was that sometimes those statements consisted only of the number of copies printed. Answering to a question related to the problems and issues that the research community is facing today, he said that one of the greatest problems is the completion rate in surveying, particularly with the probability sampling method in which call-backs are required. The completion rate has gone down. It's becoming much more difficult to get interviews.},

Drawing on his letters to the Corinthians and other early groups of Christ-followers, I argue that Paul used eloquent mediated rhetoric to conceptualize local ritual practice in such a way that it could form the basis for widespread solidarity and mass community in a geographically expanding religious sect. This was a form of mass communication centered in dispersed bodily assemblies and radiating outward to encompass ever wider regions of a distended mass society. It hinged on the Body of Christ, which in Paul's letters became a space- and time-binding medium of mass communication that held together a dispersed society of the Christ-proclaiming faithful. Paul was essentially an early medium theorist, and I argue that his bifocal attention to local assembly and distant solidarity is instructive for both the study and social practices of mass communication today.},

As a communicative phenomenon and research object, social media would appear to be in flux. Changes to existing services, the emergence of new services, and the disappearance of previously popular services testify to the sense of social media as a moving target. Researchers of social media seem to accept change, rather than continuity, as a condition for the study of social media. This is evident in our choice of research topics and data sources, but also in our discourses on social media. By examining the sense of flux of social media research in a historical perspective, this article aims to provide useful directions for future media and communication research on social media. Specifically, it suggests ways to stabilise social media as an object of study and to install a greater historical awareness in social media research.},

  abstract = {Main characteristics, challenges, current practices and future directions of mass communication research are examined from a sociology of science perspective to determine the influence of theory, method and utility to government and industry decision makers on the development of future directions of research activity in this field. Intellectual underpinnings for theory, method and utility for mass communication research activity are traced through the more established social sciences which from the 1930s through the 1960s were based on fairly stable pragmatist and behavioral assumptions. However, by the 1970s when anticipated theories and procedures of this orientation had not gone unchallenged alternate philosophies and research approaches with new perspectives on the purposes of social science research began to receive greater attention from North American scholars. Mass communication, distinctly American social science which developed during the era of stability, had by the 1970s also experienced the repercussions of challenge and disaffection with a positivist, behavioral research orientation. The degree to which challenges have affected mainstream research activity by the 1980s is examined from the perspective of the influence of funding, sponsorship arrangements and university setting. Nine hypotheses concerning the impact of institutional structures on research activity and researcher perspectives on the field are tested through survey techniques. Nominal data was gathered relative to the recent past, present, and planned future research activity of mass communication researchers affiliated with major and minor American universities. Statistical analysis using Chi-Square provided partial confirmation for the research hypotheses which posit a disassociation between the primary research activity of scholars and what they perceive as the most relevant approaches and areas for research innovation in the field. Developed as a service oriented field, mass communication research appears to continue following the original directions for research activity. However, researchers also seem to be aware and concerned about the limitations of the research agenda and supportive of developing theories, procedures and structures for more actively pursuing alternate approaches to research activity.},

Within this context, I expound a conception of communication based on ideas in information theory and on Niklas Luhmann's systems theory, which provides a theoretical foundation for the context dependency of utterances. At the same time, I introduce readers to Luhmann's version of systems theory, which is becoming more and more influential in German literary theory. The view of communication expounded here implies that as all meaning is founded on difference, an utterance can acquire meaning only by differing from other utterances, that is, by negating other positions. Therefore, the context is always part of the utterance; it enters, so to speak, into the utterance. At issue here is a specific type of context, a specific axis of difference, correlated with the utterance in a particular way. I try to show exactly how this specific conceptualization of the relation between meaning and context, between communication and difference, is to be understood. First, I discuss the systems theoretical concept of communication and illustrate it with several examples taken largely from political and literary communication. Next, I address the way this concept of communication and difference diverges from (post)structuralist theories, to which it might seem to bear some resemblance. Finally, I examine the difficult question of the relationship between communicative utterances, contexts, and their place within social systems, focusing especially on Luhmann's conceptualization of the art system.},

Williams sought to distinguish questions of technique and technical invention from their realization in the fundamentally social organization of technologies themselves and emphasized the importance of agency and intention in structuring the uses to which technologies are put. Far from technology having an inescapable internal logic of development, innovation takes place within specific social and economic contexts. For Williams, this meant that there was no pre-determined outcome to the evolution of communications innovations but a series of complex interactions between innovations and the world into which they emerge. This article will provide an assessment of Williams' work on technological innovation, his critique of determinism and his commitment to democratic communications. Williams helps us to challenge the simplistic proposition that 'the Internet has changed our world' and enables us to understand instead the ways in which contemporary social relations set limits on the development of the Internet as a democratic medium.},

This article argues that the future agenda should not restrict itself to repeating the cultural studies 'canon' of reception research, but should strengthen external relations between audience research and other domains of media and cultural studies, challenging the 'implied audience' - the ways in which audiences are theorized outside audience theory \textemdash{} within the realms of political, policy, technological, economic and social theory. It is further proposed that by developing a multi-level conception of audiences that analytically links the macro and the micro, several existing problems facing reception studies - particularly concerning the nature of audience activity and resistance - may be addressed.},

  abstract = {After a survey of the major critical trends since the generalization of synchronized film sound, this bibliographical essay sets out to delineate the way film sound studies have developed around issues of taxonomy, meaning, and reception. Focusing on the treatment of the disembodied voice by various theorists, three trends can be identified: borrowing from semiology and narratology, an essentially descriptive approach first emerges that creates a new vocabulary to talk about sound and analyze the links between sound and image. A second approach emphasizes the possible meanings of the disembodied voice, a trend heavily influenced by Lacanian theories and their later adaptations by feminist film theorists. Finally, some researchers have opted for semio-pragmatic or cognitive approaches that take into account the experience of audiences. These different approaches underline the way film sound has evolved as an object of study, to be considered as a complex and flexible phenomenon. They also have developed tools that can be applied to other audiovisual media in which the role of sound and the voice should not be underestimated.},

  abstract = {Fan studies as a discipline is still in its infancy. But even given this nascence, there have been significant shifts in the ways that it has theorized, studied and investigated fans over the first two and a half decades of research. As scholarship, fan studies has moved away from ethnographic investigations of fans as the main object of study to focus instead on the output of fan discourse as the key mode of examination. At the same time, scholars like Henry Jenkins and Matt Hills, both central to the discipline, have opened dialogue about the nature of the fan/academic, often called the `aca-fan'. This article uses the lens of aca-fandom to analyse fan answers to interview questions at a large Midwestern Doctor Who convention. Fans were asked about the role that fan studies has played in their life, how they perceive the study of fans and whether fan studies as an academic discipline has an effect on their fandom. The fans' answers reflect a critical awareness of fandom but a general ignorance of fan studies. This article argues three points to take away from this. First, fan studies needs to refocus attention back onto fans themselves through ethnographic work. Second, the discipline needs to refocus its output less on esoteric academic titles and more on popular venues. Finally, fans and academics should engage in specific dialogue to open up avenues for new fannish and academic exploration.},

The article intends to review the context and nature of critical media and communication studies, seen through the author's personal experience in national as well as international spheres. While the testimony is autobiographical, an attempt is made to contemplate career development from the outside unlike in conventional memoires. This article is a prelude to a reflective review of the author's professional and political life story, forthcoming as a book in Finnish. The introduction gives examples of the use of the term '' critical'' in the field of media and communication studies, followed by a review of different ways in which the critical concept is used in the literature of the field, leading to a reflection on the precarious relationship between the intellectual and the political. A personal testimony by the author then provides a case illustrating how a scholar becomes critical under the influence of philosophical, political and international factors. The discussion at the end offers some concluding reflections.},

In recognizing the feminist influence in the development of cultural studies, it is also important to acknowledge that this implicates feminism in an approach that often overcompensates for traditional Marxism's determinism and neglect of cultural experience by ignoring the structural constraints imposed by political and economic realities. This article traces the developments between feminism and Marxism and cultural studies and political economy, suggesting that the answer to the problem of separate spheres is not to populate one sphere at the expense of the other. Rather, what is needed is a feminist political economy that reconciles the insights of '' the politics of representing the Other'' with a much-needed material dimension that only a political economy approach can provide.},

  abstract = {The study of video game effects has been marked by two very different approaches. The first approach is represented by social scientists, who, with some exceptions, seek to understand the effects of games on users. The second approach is favored by humanists, who seek to understand the meaning and context of games. To date, these two groups have largely talked past one another due to their different goals and their different methodologies. Yet, for the advancement of science and understanding, both sets of scholarship are important and relevant. Each has contributions to make. However, unless these two groups come to possess at least a cursory understanding of the other's methodology, there will be little synthesis. This is a missed opportunity for scholars of every stripe, and ways are suggested to bridge these gaps.!},

  abstract = {Purpose \textendash{} The purpose of this paper is to examine the way American businesses and marketers used research to shape the concept of the consumer at the turn of the twentieth century. Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} A historical, cultural approach is used to examine published and unpublished writings of economists, marketers, researchers, and publishers from the 1880s to about 1930. The primary focus is Curtis Publishing Company, publisher of the Saturday Evening Post and Ladies' Home Journal, and creator of one of the first market research departments in the USA. Findings \textendash{} The argument is made that publishers and advertisers took the values of a republic, values which has long empowered and idealized white property owners, and redefined those values in terms of buying ability. In doing so, they embed many biases in their market research, yet gave businesses a working concept of the consumer and helped shape society's ideals of the consumer. Research limitations/implications \textendash{} As with all historical research, it is limited by the primary sources that have survived and are available. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper shows how early market research can provide an important perspective into the making of a consumer society, and how it can be used by historians and current practitioners to understand the methods, biases, and assumptions that have guided marketers and market research.},

It makes that case by reconstructing persistent political economic dimensions in the work of Charles Horton Cooley, who more than anyone else de-serves to be called the intellectual founder of communication study in the U.S. Drawing out previously neglected aspects of Cooley's thought, it sketches how his pragmatist, social democratic brand of political economics took a holis-tic, historically informed view of the communicative constitution and social or-ganization of selves, institutions, and political cultures. Cooley provides a starting point for a revised understanding of the history of political economic thinking about communication and ways that it has intersected with sociology, cultural study, and democratic theory},

Critically, the article argues that CITASA has become the preeminent point of reconnection between sociology and communication, allowing cross-pollination of ideas in the study of digital media, and increasingly in the study of media more broadly. The article also discusses contemporary research emphases involving computational and programming-intensive research, research on the use and effects of digital tools, and research on communication and media broadly understood.},

In response, this article reads scientometric data and game studies editorials, handbooks, and introductions through the lens of interdisciplinarity studies to assess game studies' status as an interdiscipline. It argues that game studies show drivers and hurdles typical for interdisciplines. Yet instead of establishing themselves as the broad umbrella interdiscipline of digital game research, they are becoming one narrow cultural studies multidiscipline within the growing and diversifying field of game research and education. Researchers from fields like human\textendash{}computer interaction or communication are abandoning game studies venues in favor of disciplinary ones\textemdash{}ironically thanks to game studies legitimizing game research. This article suggests that a design orientation and cross-disciplinary boundary objects such as middle range theories could help to broaden, deepen, and secure future interdisciplinary game research.},

This new literature suggests that the entirety of McLuhan's works represents a subtle critique of liberal capitalism and a call for a new emancipatory vision. For this reason, many scholars working in this literature see McLuhan as a man of the left. Although there is a discernible anti-capitalistic politics in McLuhan's works, this article will argue against the position that his anti-capitalism is rooted in leftism. Indeed, McLuhan critiques the liberal, individualistic and capitalistic print age from the right-wing side of the political spectrum. McLuhan's writings on tribalism reveal the hope that a new right-wing postmodern community will be reconstructed. Such a retrieval of the past is postmodern, since technology and myth are the forces which, McLuhan hoped, would construct this new right-wing political space.},

This article reviews ABC's impact in seven areas: nurturing teachers; establishing advanced courses, majors, and PhDs in business communication; fostering knowledge about international business communication; providing access to communicators in business; providing a voice for the profession; providing an academic home; and facilitating research. Research is the key to maturing as a discipline. Although we must meet our challenges individually and locally, ABC must continue to provide support and counsel so that we can continue the work of creating new knowledge and bringing our discipline to maturity.},

@article{simonson_serendipity_2005,
  abstract = {Though not as well-known as other of his writings, Robert K. Merton's communications research represents an important body of work. From 1941, when he first joined forces with Paul Lazarsfeld at Columbia University, through 1949, when he published his last articles in the area, Merton was active in the overlapping fields of propaganda, public opinion, and communications research. He codified methods, formulated middle range concepts, and composed a small but distinctive corpus that remains useful for contemporary study. Borrowing one of Merton's own concepts, this essay argues that his communications research was serendipitous\textemdash{}an unplanned, surprising, but highly productive episode in his nine-decade 'life of learning'. Not only was communications research the vehicle through which he and Lazarsfeld initially forged their famous partnership, it also helped Merton advance his own sociological thinking and yielded some of the best work on mass media published before 1950. Following the logic of the idea of serendipity, I trace the development of Merton's communications research from his unplanned preparation in the 1930s, through the structured opportunity he ambivalently embraced working with Lazarsfeld during the war, and on to some of the more significant consequences that followed.},

  abstract = {This paper provides an intellectual history of the media sociology of the 1970s and early 1980s, as epitomized by a selection of newsroom ethnographies (the '' newsroom studies'') that were published during this time. With a focus on the United States, I identify several discourses in both the intellectual and broader socio-political context that were contemporary with the research and whose influences can be seen in these seminal studies. In particular: organizational theory\textemdash{}of the Marxist variety, a critique of professionalism, and the social construction of reality; as well as a broad rejection of institutional authority and a liberal call for pluralism. Having identified these influences, I ask what sort of blind spots this historically specific intellectual constellation produced, and how these blind spots still influence the media sociology of today. I conclude that the intellectual and socio-political contexts of the newsroom studies led their authors to over-emphasize organizational constraints, and to focus narrowly on the most influential news outlets and their official sources; contemporary ethnographies have placed greater emphasis on journalistic agency and on the networked nature of newswork, though I question whether an emphasis on organizational constraints is not still politically warranted.},

@phdthesis{soukup_term_1985,
  abstract = {The uses of the word, 'medium,' in communication research from 1920 through 1940 reveal a complex background of philosophical and historical development. By examining 'medium' and its development, this study argues that communication research carries with it the traces of a varied set of philosophical assumptions, many problematic and most unexamined. This varied background to contemporary work demands that the terminology of the area of study be placed in its historical, social, and disciplinary context. During the early period of communication research, 'medium' draws on four clusters of meaning: meanings associated with physical connection, meanings associated with representatives and representation, meanings associated with social formation and a social environment, and meanings associated with a secondary, instrumental, function. Educators, writers, and communication practitioners apply 'medium' to various kinds of communication, including transportation, the press, film, radio, and even language. In the 1920s these usages are specific and illustrate clear differences of meaning; by 1940 the instrumental meaning overshadows the others, as a secondary function attached to a primary denotation. The history of the word not only illumines the history of communication studies but also helps shape this area of study and its practices.},

Once social scientists had worked out the selection procedures to deal with large and far-flung human populations, the stage was set for the scientific study of citizen behavior in national elections, as initially demonstrated by George Gallup in predicting the 1936 presidential race. This development unleashed a growing torrent of literature, which by now is simply overwhelming. The many high points in this literature could scarcely be listed, much less abstracted, in the brief compass allowed this essay. So I must invoke some severe selection principles in order to proceed.},

  abstract = {For many of the previous 100 years the role of a journalist was to find information, shape it into an accurate story and transmit it as quickly as possible to a mass audience via a mass medium. Today, information is no longer scarce, breaking news is no longer the province of professional journalists, mass media are declining in influence and news is easily personalized. Like many news organizations, journalism education programs are distinctly unprepared to respond to such deeply structural changes in the environment. Preliminary research indicates that the response to date has been primarily to expand technology training and reorient sequence and media emphasis tracks. The present study recommends a realignment of journalism education from an industry-centered model to a community-centered model as one way to re-engage journalism education in a more productive and vital role in the future of journalism. A community-centered focus could provide a way to conceptualize a reconstitution of journalism education to match that taking place in journalism beyond the university. Three examples from current journalism programs illustrate the implications of this analysis and provide an indication of future directions for realignment.},

It argues that the identity of the field of business communication and all variations thereof ought to be determined by the concep tual problematic underlying its intellectual inquiry rather than by its vocabu lary or instructional practices. On this basis, the paper advocates the view that business communication, management communication, and organizational communication are not, as suggested by the three articles, separate disciplines but interdependent areas of study nested within the domain of the mother discipline of communication. The paper concludes by making the plea for a more inclusive editorial policy that adopts an eclectic methodological stance and encourages substantive debates relating to the nature and processes of communication as constituted by the practical milieu of business.},

I examine Hoggart as a literary critic, using examples from his earliest book on Auden to show how the working-class intellectual engages with canonical literature in a 'high' art form and then I consider a range of his writings about literature to show the importance of literary criticism for Hoggart and his love of literature. This is important because love of literature and commitment to a rigorous literary critical method inform all Hoggart's writing on culture. An understanding of his literary criticism is key to appreciating his cultural analysis and can also offer a way forward at a time when the literary may have been abandoned in the quest for the popular.},

The contribution interrogates this labor/play dialectic while looking at recent literature on games being produced within the current capitalist and neoliberal system, focusing on phenomena like '' playbour'' and on key elements discussed in these theories, from the affordances and limitations of technology to the immaterial technological tools used by gamers and game makers. The article argues that looking at Caillois in relation to Marxism would provide an interesting critical perspective, one that has been underexplored by current approaches. The authors note that contemporary concerns on capitalism and games are far from being at odds with Caillois' distinction between labur and play and suggest that the influence of Marxism on Caillois' writings would provide an interesting terrain of further discussion.},

It starts with where I entered the evolution of the idea as one of his students, points out a problem that emerged as a consequence of generalising information measures from simple to complex systems, i.e. systems with many variables, shows how this problem was eventually solved, and ends with how his idea of decomposing complex systems into smaller interactions reappears in one of the most complex technologies of our time: cyberspace. While nobody could anticipate the complexities that developed since, Ashby's idea of understanding complex systems in terms of manageable interactions, which I call electronic artefacts, is actually practised today and cyberspace is again worth analysing in information theoretical terms.},

The theoretical grapplings of these thinkers with the symbolic mediation of society, however inadequate they are, show us that the relation between society and its self-representations is a problem for modern society generally, not only for the putatively '' postmodern''; climate of the late twentieth century.},

@book{simpson_science_1994,
  abstract = {In this provocative study, Christopher Simpson demonstrates how the government-funded psychological warfare programs of the Cold War years underwrote the academic studies that formed the basis for much of modern communication research. U.S. psychological warfare programs in the Philippines, Middle East and Southeast Asia became essential in the creation and survival of what is widely considered to be mainstream mass communication studies. They aided in forming the widely held preconceptions that persist today in communication studies, public opinion research, and in the types of counterinsurgency operations that are today known as "public diplomacy" and "low intensity conflict.". Science of Coercion: Communication Research and Psychological Warfare, 1945-1960 provides the first thorough examination of the role of the CIA, Pentagon, and other U.S. security agencies in the evolution of modern communication studies. Christopher Simpson contends that it is unlikely that communication research could have emerged in its present form without regular transfusions of money from U.S. military, intelligence, and propaganda agencies during the Cold War. These agencies saw mass communication as an instrument for persuading or dominating targeted groups in the United States and abroad; as a tool for improving military operations; and perhaps most fundamentally, as a means to extend U.S. influence more widely than ever before at a relatively modest cost. Communication research, in turn, became for a time the preferred method for testing and developing such techniques . Science of Coercion outlines the history of U.S. psychological warfare between 1945 and 1960, discussing the underlying theories, activities, and administrative structure of this type of communication enterprise. In the process, Simpson documents the role played by prominent mass communication researchers including Wilbur Schramm, Ithiel de Sola Pool, Samuel Stouffer, and Paul Lazarsfield to demonstrate the links between the so-called "founding fathers" of communication studies in the United States and psychological warfare programs. Drawing on long-classified documents and extensive archival research, Simpson has produced a fascinating study in the history of science and the sociology of knowledge. Science of Coercion offers valuable insights into the dynamics of ideology and the social psychology of mass communication. It will provide informative reading for scholars and students of communication, the history of science, and social psychology, as well as the general reader.},

An example of this is philosopher Benedict of Spinoza's ideas on the power of images and the importance of emotions to explain human behavior. This article delves into how Spinoza's ideas have been transmitted to classic public relations authors such as Walter Lippmann and Edward Bernays through the works of their masters and their mentors: George Santayana, who was one of Lippmann's philosophy professors at Harvard, and Sigmund Freud, an uncle of Bernays whose psychoanalysis theory shaped Bernays' approach to persuasion. In contrast to these public relations masters of persuasion who had a pessimistic view of the human condition, Spinoza's Ethics is based on a positive anthropology of man that squares well with contemporary and more ethical relationship-building approaches to public relations.},

  abstract = {This dissertation is an intellectual history and critical analysis of medium theory investigations of communication technologies. The more common approaches to viewing technology as savior or slayer are a consequence of the technological sublime in our time of technological saturation. It is argued that the way to break out of this technological sublime-induced grand dichotomy is to follow the lead of medium theorists who investigate the unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture, and to follow the lead of marxists who place technological developments within the larger dynamic of a system based on the drive for profit. Intellectual influences and theoretical implications of the work of prominent scholars such as Harold Adams Innis, Herbert Marshall McLuhan, Joshua Meyrowitz, James Carey, Walter Ong, and Neil Postman are analyzed throughout the dissertation. The main contribution of medium theorists has been their ability to analyze the impact of unintended consequences of a particular medium on consciousness and culture; their collective weakness has been a tendency to slight important social factors such as the drive for profit, inequality, and class. To correct this problem, it is argued that medium theory should be merged with an activist marxist tradition. A synthesis of activist marxism and medium theory, it is argued, will give to marxist scholars a better sense of unintended consequences and to medium theorists a better sense of the drive for profit, inequality, and class. Finally, it is argued that scholarship in general, and marxist/medium theory scholarship in particular, is most fruitful when scholars are actively aware of, and engaged in, significant struggles of the day. Just as activist marxists argue for theoretically informed activism, scholarship would benefit from activist informed theory. It is at the point of praxis, theory informed action and action informed theory, that thought and action converge to enhance understanding of our world and to make the world a better place.},

  abstract = {The concept of mass goes back a long way to characterize a society that consists of people somehow connected by communication while, at the same time, also dispersed in space and essentially detached from one another. Mass has also been a pejorative for critics of modern capitalist society and its culture. In the years after World War II, this latter use of the term became the target of a broadside attack by several highly credentialed scholars, who questioned its value as an analytic tool. This paper, starting with Ferdinand T{\"o}nnies, offers a brief overview of both the origins of the concept of mass and its subsequent refinement by French, German, and American sociologists into the mid-1930s. Distinguishing between its ideological connotations and the analytic use of the term helps us to focus on the most general and persistent effects of mass communication: expanding the range of common experience and making people more responsive to distant events. This effect is magnified by the ubiquity of mass media; practically no one, not even those who scorn them, can altogether escape their influence.},

This paper puzzles over the lack of reference \textendash{} by McLuhan, his mentors, and his critics \textendash{} to an earlier group of British thinkers (from Shaftesbury to Adam Smith) who deliberated over the differences among the arts. Their treatises on how the mind processes visual and auditory information remarkably foreshadow McLuhan's assertion that the media constrain how we think and feel. Present-day debate over the effects of new media technology, as well as current theories of reception, reflect McLuhan's stimulating (though exasperating) insights. His footprints also point to cognitive science and, of course, to globalism.},

Still, in the era of globalization, internationalistic agendas have to be radicalized, opened up also to non-Western media thought, setting out from existing regional modernities and transformations. Thus, globalization calls for regional, not universalistic epistemologies and for cross-disciplinary, not intra-disciplinary research efforts. The chapter develops these arguments, first by recapitulating the criticism of the media and development paradigm \textendash{} an early theory of media and social change. This is followed up by a summary report on media and global inequalities in the post-Cold War period, suggesting that the relations between media, politics and economy develop contrary to the prescriptions of received models. This leads to a reinforced questioning of the very distinctions between, e.g., politics, economy and culture in media studies, as illustrated by examples from case studies of recent developments in new democracies and (neo)authoritarian systems.},

Scholars in the Humanities have traditionally studied the meaning of human expression in language, philosophy, the Arts and literature. Social scientists have focused on the relations between media institutions and other institutions, not least political ones. With the so-called 'cultural turn' in the 1980s, media scholars' interest shifted to the role of media in the development of culture, on the potential of media to generate meaning in a broader sense, and on the adaptation of media messages to culturally dominant forms of understanding. Today, the field is characterized by extreme diversity and extensive specialization. Studies on the systems level are few. At the same time, contemporary multicultural and global societies raise more complex issues than ever before. Given the high degree of specialization, scholars in the field may not be exposed to the impulses needed for them to be able to formulate incisive research problems. For the discipline to produce new insights and new knowledge requires collaboration - within the discipline, but above all collaboration across academic as well as national frontiers},

  abstract = {Fred Casmir's third culture building (TCB) framework made a major theoretical contribution to communication studies. Casmir conceptualized the framework as an active process whereby different cultural groups come together to form a third culture between them. The third culture then becomes a common ground for all participants; a cognitive space that incorporates elements of both cultures and yet remains separate and distinct. Third culture building is a departure from adoption (the process of taking on the cultural mores of another) or adaptation (modifying one's cultural mores to better fit those of another), and achieved through deliberate development in an extended process, during which all participants gain an understanding of, and appreciation for, one another. In this essay, the authors review the life and work of Fred Casmir \textendash{} a leading figure in establishing intercultural communication as a specific area of study. Next the authors discuss the ideological foundations, intended use, key applications and heuristic value of Casmir's third culture building framework.},

  abstract = {While having a solid foundation in philosophy, Walter J. Ong did not identify with any philosophical school or movement, preferring to interpret philosophy simply as love of wisdom, which is best pursued not by logic and treatise, but by rhetoric and conversation. Beginning during his formative years at Saint Louis University in the 1940s, he integrated metaphysics and communication, suggesting that the focus of philosophy should be not on the idea but on being. It is within these perspectives that Ong probed issues that later became identified with media ecology. Thomism provided a '' furniture of mind'' to weigh post-Hegelian dialectic and to probe the implications of existentialistic dialogue (Jaspers, Camus-Sartre, Marcel); to phenomenologically explore personalist interiority and encounter (Lavelle, Buber, Hopkins); to interpret human thought within the context of cosmic time and evolution (Teilhard); to consider speech philosophy as an alternative to Ramist and Cartesian methodology (Rosenstock-Huessy); and to promulgate an oral hermeneutic that contextualizes concept within being (Bakhtin, Rosenstock-Huessy). The argument of this essay is supported by substantial quotation of previously unpublished materials from the Walter J. Ong archival collection at Saint Louis University.},

A total of 131 articles were coded for general information about journals, primary topic/context of the study, use of theories or models, research methods, units of analysis/types of sample, and countries or locations. Findings showed that the number of mobile communication-related studies increased over the time period of interest. Scholars examined uses and users' characteristics of mobile communication as well as the effects of mobile media on everyday life. Most studies used quantitative methods such as survey of the general population. Theories or theoretical models were not frequently used in mobile communication research. Regarding the usage of theories or theoretical models, about half of mobile communication studies (48.1\%) used theories and/or models as theoretical frameworks. Implications for improving this field of research are specifically discussed.},

Fears about the media effect on the behaviour of readers became recurring phenomena \textendash{} in some cases provoking reactions characterised as a moral panic. These periodic outbursts of disquiet can be best understood as panics about the potential impact of the media on public morality. Such reactions were not simply media panics but panics about the effects of the media. The focus of anxiety was not on any particular issue but on the threat to moral authority posed by the media on the outlook and behaviour of the public. By its very existence the media appeared to represent a potential threat to the moral order. Exploring the moral dimension of this reaction is essential for the study of moral panics.},

The main argument is that what has been frequently ignored is the supranational dimension of the term European'. Thus, while the field of European film studies has witnessed a number of significant shifts in emphasis (most pertinently the refocusing from art cinema towards popular film genres), the core debate still primarily centres on national cinemas. The article then suggests engaging in areas that exemplify interconnectedness between national cinemas. These include patterns of inter-European migration and issues of multiculturalism; industrial practices such as co-productions; as well as localized strategies of receiving foreign films through mechanisms of translation and adaptation.},

It spurred an entire literature of academic research both about \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} and the idea of technology assessment more generally. Understanding the legislative history and implementation of the Technology Assessment Act is crucial not just for scholarship, though. \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} was a blueprint for institutionalizing politically accountable technology assessment. Even as technologies advance at rapid rates, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} still offers valuable lessons that scholars and policy-makers alike ought to glean. This paper places \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} in a contemporary context of (institutionalized) technology assessment. It contributes to a better understanding of OTA's origins by tracing its lineage to a set of federal reports beginning in 1929. It then analyzes OTA's response to pragmatic implementation questions of how to strike a balance between speed, depth, scope, and temporal focus. Lastly, it uses a public values framework to critique OTA's failure to adequately incorporate participatory elements into its processes.},

  abstract = {The focus of the article is on the author's experience as learner and teacher. The task of preparing law students for their professional life is compared to that of teaching undergraduates who, in the uniquely strenuous College of the University of Chicago, are interested in books and ideas and are not im\- mediately job-driven. Whereas in the law school setting the author, like other law professors, worked alone, in the College he worked with a staff of colleagues who shared in the choice of readings and in lectures to the entire student body-altogether, in the author's view, a more demanding task for the teacher. Graduate education in sociology is again different: the student is an apprentice professional, but there is no clear road toward professional prac\- tice; the faculty member as mentor on the disse:rtation helps pilot the appren\- tice through the cross-currents of conflict in the field and in the particular department. Teaching undergraduates in Harvard College, the author reports, involved tasks different from those faced in the College of the University of Chicago. Rather than working, as at Chicago, with a staff of presumptive equals, at Harvard the author recruited advanced graduate students and junior (and on occasion, senior) faculty whom he treated as colleagues, but whom Harvard undergraduates tended to deprecate as mere "section men," i.e. teaching assistants. The author details efforts to overcome what was 30 years ago the fabled yet quite real pose of "Harvard indifference"-a lack of engagement with subject matter and with noncelebrity faculty. The Harvard colleague group worked to get students to do small pieces of fieldwork, not merely as exercises, but out of interest in a topic and an idea. When with the rise of a radical student-faculty "movement" many undergraduates became less "cool," the problems of teaching subtly changed. Always, the author notes, teaching is contextual and often needs to work against the prevailing tide.},

  abstract = {With the rise of the democratic state came a strong emphasis on "the public" or "public opinion" in the study of politics. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, a number of important works examined the contours of public opinion within a democracy. The study of public opinion since this early period has only intensified. However, recent work on public opinion is problematic: the theoretical and normative concerns and the political / sociological focus of the early works on public opinion are largely missing. Most modern studies of public opinion are psychologically driven and often truncated from broad concerns of American politics and democratic theory. In this article, I explicate the history of public opinion research, paying particular attention to the "early" works and how their concerns and emphases have been neglected by many "later" studies of public opinion. Through this history I aim to highlight the differences between the early and later phases and to suggest that much was lost in neglecting the concerns of the early writers on public opinion. While some contemporary researchers are, in fact, harking back to the early work, I conclude that a more thorough re-acquaintance with the classics of public opinion is necessary.},

  abstract = {Moving world-systems analysis into the cultural realm, Richard E. Lee locates the cultural studies movement within a broad historical and geopolitical framework. He illuminates how order and conflict have been reflected and negotiated in the sphere of knowledge production by situating the emergence of cultural studies at the intersection of post\textendash{}1945 international and British politics and a two-hundred-year history of conservative critical practice. Tracing British criticism from the period of the French Revolution through the 1960s, he describes how cultural studies in its infancy recombined the elite literary critical tradition with the First New Left's concerns for history and popular culture\textemdash{}just as the liberal consensus began to come apart. Lee tracks the intellectual project of cultural studies as it developed over three decades, beginning with its institutional foundation at the University of Birmingham's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies (CCCS). He links work at the CCCS to the events of 1968 and explores cultural studies' engagement with theory in the debates on structuralism. He considers the shift within the discipline away from issues of working-class culture toward questions of identity politics in the fields of race and gender. He follows the expansion of the cultural studies project from Britain to Australia, Canada, South Africa, and the United States. Contextualizing the development and spread of cultural studies within the longue dur{\'e}e structures of knowledge in the modern world-system, Lee assesses its past and future as an agent of political and social change.},

Showing a singular intellectual honesty, Ludovico Silva worked on a general theory of ideology, challenging the official Marxism and leftist political forces of the age. Based on Marx\textasciiacute{}s difference between use value and exchange value, Silva argued that the Marxist category of surplus needed an equivalent in the symbolic realm; hence he developed the concept of ideological surplus in order to reject mechanical interpretations of ideology. Thus, Silva, among other scholars, contributed to Latin American communication studies by incorporating power and domination as structural forces in the making of social relations. The ideological power of media became the ultimate concern in media studies, questioning the explanatory value of the functionalist and quantitative studies focused on media effects, which were dominant at that time. Silva\textasciiacute{}s work is recovered here in a historical perspective, stressing his intellectual commitment to the truth, and his contribution to move Latin American communication studies from a conventional academic stance to a critical one.},

  abstract = {In a time in which an exuberant, trans-classical, non-trivial machine culture redesigns terminologies, remodels logics, produces new evidence, and reorganizes semantic resources, a new, neocybernetic regime of truth is taking shape. Many of our recent self-descriptions and theory formations are coined by our media-technological condition. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the work of Niklas Luhmann, especially in his inherent narrative of the history of rationality. This essay attempts to reconstruct Luhmann's redescription of European rationality, especially the media- and machine-historical conditions that remain apparent in Luhmann's account. The decisive issue is that Luhmann's history of rationality reveals the technological unconscious of systems theory and indeed the epochal imaginary it belongs to. With the help of the theories of machines developed by von Foerster, Simondon and G{\"u}nther, Luhmann's oeuvre must be read as probably the most striking conceptual edifice to emerge from what could be called the 20th-century's epochal technological shift of meaning.},

George Gallup's polling techniques first achieved fame when he accurately predicted that Franklin D. Roosevelt would be reelected president in 1936. Gallup had devised an extremely effective sampling method that took households from all income brackets into account, and Hollywood studio executives quickly pounced on the value of Gallup's research. Soon he was gauging reactions to stars and scripts for RKO Pictures, David O. Selznick, and Walt Disney and taking the public's temperature on Orson Welles and Desi Arnaz, couples such as Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and films like Gone with the Wind, Dumbo, and Fantasia. Through interviews and extensive research, Susan Ohmer traces Gallup's groundbreaking intellectual and methodological developments, examining his comprehensive approach to market research from his early education in the advertising industry to his later work in Hollywood. The results of his opinion polls offer a fascinating glimpse at the class and gender differences of the time as well as popular sentiment toward social and political issues.},

  abstract = {This article argues that the abundance of Greek figures and scenarios in Kittler's recent work points to a shift in his oeuvre, which, however, does not represent a radical break with his 'hardware studies'. At the turn of the 21st century, Kittler champions an emphatic notion of culture as a necessary supplement to science and technology. This conceptual marriage mediates grand historical narratives of cultural identity. Specifically, Kittler's texts provide us with narratives of Greek origin which serve to re-capture collective identities in the age of globalization. On the explicit level, this identity is predominantly European, but the search has national components as well. With his turn to culture, the organizing trope of 19th-century German nationalism, Kittler has also embraced the legacy of German philhellenism, which articulated national identities through the theme of 'elective affinity'. Kittler's Greece occupies the very structural place it had in 19th-century German philhellenism: It stands in for both the foundation of European civilization and its virtual better self, a realm of sensual culture untainted by modern capitalism and Empire. Most of the figures inhabiting this realm are familiar from 19th-century discourse as well, but these discursive loops are fueled by contemporary feedback. Kittler's Greek narratives have developed out of postwar academic discourses and connect to other post-unification Greek fantasies.},

  abstract = {Systematic data on the recent history of communication studies in U.S. higher education are much needed. Statistical data can mislead, however, when numbers are reported without careful attention to the shifting classification schemes that underlie them. The work that is needed in order to understand the recent emergence of a communication discipline is at least as much theoretical and interpretive as it is empirical. To illustrate this point, we explore two types of indicators of growth and transformation of communication studies: statistics on degrees granted and trends in the classification of books and serials. For each type of indicator we show that the emergence of communication as a category has involved qualitative transformation of the category itself as well as quantitative growth within the category. This categorical transformation, and its deeper roots in the evolution of communication as a cultural practice, will be basic to any adequate interpretation of our discipline's increasing centrality in academe and in society.},

''The Invasion from Mars'' by Hadley Cantril, Herta Herzog and Hazel Gaudet and ''Mass Persuasion'' by R. K. Merton, Marjorie Fiske and Alberta Curtis have many similarities. Both investigations were affiliated to the Princeton-Columbia workshop; both were connected with P. F. Lazarsfeld's personality; both showed the influence of radio broadcasting to be socially differentiated and conditioned; both researches were joined with the war, which interfered in them as a factor of motivation; both used ''focused interviews'' and similar procedures and verified their results by surveys; both projects belonged to the class of ''Firehouse Research'' demanding, contrary to expectations, collection of data immediately after the event. The paper acquaints readers with the questions, methods and results of both investigations. It shows and emphasises the combined use of different methods with the unique intent of problem-understanding and positively evaluates the look to the workshop, which both publications offer.},

This article reviews evidence over five decades regarding the changing place of television in children's lives. It argues that, notwithstanding postwar trends that have significantly changed adolescence, the family home, and wider consumer society, there was time for the 1950s family experiment to spawn the 1960s and 1970s family television experiment, thereby shaping normative expectations\textendash{}academic, policy, and popular\textendash{}regarding television audiences for years to come. At the turn of the twenty-first century, we must recognize that it was the underlying long-term trend of individualization, and its associated trends of consumerism, globalization, and democratization, that, historically and now, more profoundly frame the place of television in the family.},

Answering to a question on the present condition of advertising research Ziesel said that, now research has spread enormously in many ways it has shifted from the agency and the media to the manufacturers. The agencies concentrate more and more on what is called creative research following the bifurcation that began with idea of separating the creative work from the bulk of administrative and mechanical work. He thinks research has followed it. The shift away from the agencies was facilitated by a perennial headache namely, the problem of billing research from the agency. Every so often the agency had to absorb these costs, so the development was really by mutual agreement, toward the manufacturer taking charge of his own research. On asking Ziesel about the legal side of his activities, Ziesel said that his work during the last 20 years at the University of Chicago Law School, was making lawyers aware that there is more to law than only study, constitutions, court decisions, and statutes.},

One thinks of the introduction of Antonio Gramsci's writings to IR theorists by Robert Cox, for example, and the 'school' that has developed in its wake. Similarly, the works of Anthony Giddens, Michel Foucault, and Jurgen Habermas are all relatively familiar to most IR theorists not because of their writings on world politics per se, but because they were imported into the field by roving theorists. Many others of varying success could be cited as well. Such cross-disciplinary excursions are important because they inject vitality into a field that \textendash{} in the opinion of some at least\textemdash{}is in need of rejuvenation in the face of contemporary changes. In this paper, I elaborate on the work of the Canadian communications theorist Harold Innis, situating his work within contemporary IR theory while underlining his historicism, holism, and attention to time-space biases.},

  abstract = {What is metal studies? How can we define and characterize it? How has it emerged as a body of academic enquiry? What are its dominant disciplinary strands, theoretical concepts and preferred methodologies? Which studies have claimed most attention, defined the goals of scholarship, typical research strategies and values? How has the claim for the legitimacy or symbolic value of metal scholarship been achieved (if it has): over time and through gradual acceptance or through conflict and contestation? How can this process of formation, or strategy of legitimation, be mapped, examined and interrogated and which methods of historical, institutional and cultural analysis are best suited to this task? Working with the most complete bibliography to date of published research on heavy metal, music and culture (the MSBD), this article employs Foucault's archaeological "method" to examine the institutional, cultural and political contexts and conflicts that inform the genealogy of this scholarship. Such analysis reveals a formative, largely negative account of heavy metal to be found in the "sociology of rock"; a large volume of psychology work, examining heavy metal music preference as an indicator of youth risk, deviance and delinquency; sociological work on youth and deviancy critical of the values of this research and its links to social policy and politics; culminating in the work of Weinstein and Walser, who advocate a perspective sympathetic to the values of heavy metal fans themselves. Following Bourdieu, I interpret such symbolic strategies as claims for expertise within the academic field that are high or low in symbolic capital to the extent they can attain disciplinary autonomy. I then go on to examine the most recent strands of research, within cultural studies and ethnomusicology, concerned with the global metal music diaspora, and consider to what extent such work is constitutive of a coherent subfield of metal studies that can be distinguished from earlier work and what the implications of this might be.},

A marketing guy really is a guy who basically would like to have his own business and, all too often because circumstances are such, cannot have it. And it seems to him that the big contribution that marketing research people make is to be marketing guides to people who have marketing jobs. Answering to a question about his advise to a young person who was just entering the research field he said that the first thing the person should do is to go out and do door-to-door interviewing.

But popular culture may be studied as a phenomenon of social expedients in contrast to art, which follows its own immanent norms. Difficulties which the standard methods of empirical research incur in dealing with the concrete phenomena of popular culture may be avoided if a historical and philosophical frame of reference is used. Such qualitative approaches as exist are permeated with categories like the decline of the individual, the interdependency of social control and mass communications, the psychology of wish-fulfilling, and the like.},

  abstract = {Questions posed by Carolyn Steedman prompted this article on what cultural studies wants from history. Two larger arguments frame some answers. The first concerns 'transdisciplinarity', a new context for cultural studies, created by the 'cultural turn' in humanities and social sciences more generally. The second addresses the need to distinguish history as a discipline from a wider range of approaches that grasp the 'historicity' or 'temporality' of human life. The work of the hermeneutic philosopher, Paul Ricoeur, helps to identify this difference and engages with the double character of historical work: part empirical study, part 'fiction'. The article itself can be read as a narrative about history and cultural studies \textendash{} a story of debts and differences, polemics and splits, convergences and renewed dialogue. The article urges us to recognize the implications for historical cultural studies of moves towards 'culturality' in history.},

  abstract = {For a generation of political activists growing up in the 1930's opposing Fascism was a priority. The policy of appeasing Hitler and the non-partisan stance of the Labour Party in the face of the Spanish Civil War made the Communist Party an attractive alternative. From this generation emerged key figures in academia and publishing: Eric Hobsbawm, Ralph Miliband, John Saville, Martin Eve, Dorothy and Edward Thompson, and Raymond Williams. Woodhams studies the experiences of this generation, the motives which attracted them towards the CPGB, and their reactions to and experiences in the Second World War. He examines what opportunities were open to them in the post-war years and their influence particularly in the field of adult education. He argues that Raymond Williams anticipated some of the thinking of the new left, especially in the field of cultural studies. But in the shadow of the1956 events in Hungary another new left emerged drawing on post-war experiences and circumstances. This collective biography throws a new light on the continuities and breaks in British political and intellectual history. It challenges conventional periodization separating pre- and post-war history and questions the sources of continuity and change in Britain.},

These dual origins influenced the debate over journalism education from the mid-nineteenth century. News professionals and university educators pondered whether journalists needed to be college-educated, whether they needed a liberal arts degree, or whether they needed professional education that combined liberal arts and practical training. These debates were complex and political, representing issues of localism versus nationalism, the role of professional schools within the American university, and the rise of social science. The tension between educating reporters and editors to improve the quality of journalism or contribute to a democracy versus training them to function efficiently in a newspaper office\textemdash{}or any media environment\textemdash{}continues today.},

Against this background, this paper reviews the methodological problems of and first steps taken towards a more action-oriented and, at the same time, cohesive ("European") concept of cultural research, which extends beyond a mere comparison of national policies and experiences. This is illustrated through individual research projects and the more recent appearance of ERICarts, the European Research Institute for Comparative Cultural Policy and the Arts.},

In addition, because fundamental changes in higher education in more modern times affected emphases and delivery of the course, we focus on the relationship between general education and the basic course and the significant curricular changes to the course during the latter part of the 20th century.

  abstract = {Through surveying the literature on Mexican mass media published in American academic journals and books from 1945 to 1994, and the published literature in Mexico by Mexican researchers during the same period, this thesis assesses the influence of U.S. mass communication research ideologies and posits that Western scholars, mostly Americans, approach the study of Mexican mass media according to Western social, political, and cultural values. In general, traditional American social science methodologies, in particular, mass communication research, dominate Mexican mass media studies. Specifically, American scholars have tended to direct their analysis to the free expression of newspapers. This study found that most Americans in this field have limited themselves to judging the entirety of Mexican mass media from an American cultural viewpoint. In support of this conclusion, critical researchers have linked the problem of exporting 'alien' methods of study to Mexico and of bypassing or ignoring the social, cultural, and political realities of Mexico and other Latin American countries. This thesis shows how traditional American international media research conceives the Mexican media system from an American cultural perspective, thereby introducing a conceptualization of culture that implies the context of a free market of ideas in a free market economy. Still, based on a Cultural studies perspective, as posited by Stuart Hall and others, this study shows that by framing research questions based on Mexico's social, economic, and political realities (for instance, a dependent, capitalist society as opposed to an advanced, capitalist one), ethnocentric biases are avoided. The main question this thesis studies is: What approach have American scholars taken in their analysis of Mexican mass media? Findings of the research confirm the common complaint that the bulk of research carried out by American mass media scholars on Latin America has lacked sensitivity toward its cultural values, political systems, and economic conditions. Similarly, this study found that much of the media research in Mexico carried out by Mexican scholars followed lines of inquiry, theories, and methodologies proposed by Western researchers. Finally, this research shows that lack of indigenous research accounts for the theoretical dependency of Mexican scholarly works.},

@book{horowitz_consuming_2012,
  abstract = {How is it that American intellectuals, who had for 150 years worried about the deleterious effects of affluence, more recently began to emphasize pleasure, playfulness, and symbolic exchange as the essence of a vibrant consumer culture? The New York intellectuals of the 1930s rejected any serious or analytical discussion, let alone appreciation, of popular culture, which they viewed as morally questionable. Beginning in the 1950s, however, new perspectives emerged outside and within the United States that challenged this dominant thinking. Consuming Pleasures reveals how a group of writers shifted attention from condemnation to critical appreciation, critiqued cultural hierarchies and moralistic approaches, and explored the symbolic processes by which individuals and groups communicate. Historian Daniel Horowitz traces the emergence of these new perspectives through a series of intellectual biographies. With writers and readers from the United States at the center, the story begins in Western Europe in the early 1950s and ends in the early 1970s, when American intellectuals increasingly appreciated the rich inventiveness of popular culture. Drawing on sources both familiar and newly discovered, this transnational intellectual history plays familiar works off each other in fresh ways. Among those whose work is featured are J{\"u}rgen Habermas, Roland Barthes, Umberto Eco, Walter Benjamin, C. L. R. James, David Riesman and Marshall McLuhan, Richard Hoggart, members of London's Independent Group, Stuart Hall, Paddy Whannel, Tom Wolfe, Herbert Gans, Susan Sontag, Reyner Banham, and Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown.},

However, the Journal focused most of its critical energies on what were known at the time as groundlevel comics, small, independently published comics that utilised the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror and superheroes. The Journal largely ignored alternative comics until the late 1980s, and it wasn't until the 1990s that the Journal fully embraced them as the driving force for the evolution and improvement of American comics.},

In his work at the Iowa Child Welfare Research Station between 1935 and 1944, Lewin tried to recreate the scientific microculture that had formed around him in Berlin. In the process, he converted biography into theory, adapting to current cultural concerns, to then-prevailing research styles, and to changing institutional andfunding networks in American psychology. However, despite their considerable impact at the time, the later reception of Lewin's ideas and methods by American psychologists was ambivalent.},

  abstract = {In this intellectual history of British cultural Marxism, Dennis Dworkin explores one of the most influential bodies of contemporary thought. Tracing its development from beginnings in postwar Britain, through its various transformations in the 1960s and 1970s, to the emergence of British cultural studies at Birmingham, and up to the advent of Thatcherism, Dworkin shows this history to reflect a coherent intellectual tradition, one that represents an implicit and explicit theoretical effort to resolve the crisis of the postwar British Left. Limited to neither a single discipline nor a particular intellectual figure, this book comprehensively views British cultural Marxism in terms of the dialogue between historians and the originators of cultural studies and in its relationship to the new left and feminist movements. From the contributions of Eric Hobsbawm, Christopher Hill, Sheila Rowbotham, Rodney Hilton, Catherine Hall, and E. P. Thompson to those of Perry Anderson, Barbara Taylor, Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, and Dick Hebdidge, Dworkin examines the debates over issues of culture and society, structure and agency, experience and ideology, and theory and practice. The rise, demise, and reorganization of journals such as The Reasoner, The New Reasoner, Universities and Left Review, New Left Review, Past and Present are also part of the history told in this volume. In every instance, the focus of Dworkin's attention is the intellectual work seen in its political context. Capturing the excitement and commitment that more than one generation of historians, literary critics, art historians, philosophers, and cultural theorists have felt about an unorthodox and critical tradition ofMarxist theory, Cultural Marxism in Postwar Britain will appeal to students and scholars of cultural studies as well as those interested in the broader terrain of Marxist theory and contemporary critical theory.},

@article{frey_cultural_2010,
  abstract = {The heyday of classical film theory is predominantly understood to have been concerned with ontological and formal matters and with promoting film as an art. Pursuing the shapes and contours of the new medium, many writers on cinema from the 1920s heralded cinema as a 'universal language'. Examining the 'universal language' thesis, one finds a remarkable variety to the various arguments. By undertaking a close prospect of just one version of the 'universal language' thesis by a single writer, B{\'e}la Bal{\'a}zs, this essay intends to complicate the enterprise of 1920s 'classical film theory'. Tracing back the messy trail of reception and production and returning to the heart of Bal{\'a}zs's output, one finds a universal language which is neither truly universal, nor technically a language. Bal{\'a}zs's writings on cinema and language form the basis of a Janus-faced philosophy caught between future and past, film theory and human history, between an anthropology of the person and a prescription for various peoples. Re-examining Bal{\'a}zs and interrogating the 'universal language thesis' draws attention to the various modes, functions and addressees of what is called 'classical film theory' and to the need for new historiographical paradigms which take material matters of production and reception into account. At the same time, Bal{\'a}zs serves as an example for what unites many of the 1920s classical film theorists: the tension between the universal and the nationally specific and between their proposed theories and implied histories of film.},

Perhaps more importantly, this essay highlights how the works of these two media ecologists fit into and embody a North American cultural studies approach to media studies. The intent of this essay is to push the understanding of the intellectual roots of media ecology toward a broader analysis of how media ecology is embedded in, and advocates for, the larger move in communication studies away from narrow, quantitative effects research and towards qualitative and interdisciplinary scholarship that is North American cultural studies.},

Retrieving the historical nexus questions views that treat and limit British cultural studies to being mainly an intellectual import-export phenomenon. The overlooked historical nexus fosters trivialization anad caricature of cultural studies' incorporation in the American academia, resulting in both conservative antipathy and left disappointments feeding into the common binary narratives of the 'failure' of cultural studies for being too Marxist and not Marxist enough.

The initiative has to do with the entire field of higher education (India having one of the biggest higher education systems in the world), but interestingly it was incubated by the Center for the Study of Culture and Society (CSCS). The painstaking process of the gestation of collaborative interdisciplinary themes/fields of research/teaching and the labor of negotiation with policy-makers and grantees in the field of higher education by a Cultural Studies centre is thus the focus of this paper. Called the Higher Education Cell, an important aspect of the initiative's genealogy is that it is based on (a) a critique of the existing disciplines and an attention to the birthing of 'new thematic/field specifics' as also (b) a critique of the research undertaken in mainstream institutions and an attention to new research methodologies. The Higher Education Cell is at present focusing on four major functions through which it plans to engage with the higher education sector. These functions are (i) Incubation of Research Initiatives, (ii) Institutional Collaborations, (iii) Documentation and Archiving, and (iv) Grant Development. The research initiatives, which include Globalization and Higher Education, General Education in Comparative Perspective, Regional Language Resources, and Social Justice in Higher Education, have been conceived through collaborations with a range of higher education institutions. The wider context of the labor of negotiation is one where (1) new institutional structures are being experimented with, resulting in the emergence of 'institutions with a difference', (2) new interdisciplinary courseware or new themes/fields of research/teaching are being created (such as film-media studies, gender-sexuality-Dalit studies, migration studies, environment studies) and (3) new research and pedagogic methodologies are being given shape.},

The article starts with a personal narration on how the author was introduced to this novel field by entering the first graduate programme in Cultural Studies in Colombia. Here, it locates the major tensions, stereotypes and loud silences characteristic of the social sciences in Colombia in which this institutionalization was infused and also threatened by the 1990s. But far from thinking that this recent event inaugurated an intellectual project thanks to the importation of theories and methodologies at this moment, the article describes previous intellectual traditions like the one influenced by the works of Orlando Fals Borda that had challenged positivist and neutral intellectual approaches to major problems in Colombia. Also, it highlights the influence that the work of Jes{\'u}s Mart{\'i}n Barbero had through his paramount work on media and mediation since the 1970s. Afterwards, the article succinctly contextualizes the institutionalization of Cultural Studies in the 1990s through the emergence of the Ministry of Culture and the multicultural mantra and a whole scholarly and state's concern for cultural industries and culture policies. Finally, it describes the ?perverse confluences? between these new events and the arrival of neoliberal policies that had radically changed and challenged Colombian public and private universities. The article concludes with a contrasting image between a multiplication of interests, programmes, departments, conferences and publications in Cultural Studies in the larger universities in Colombia and their rampant transformation through the new scripts of audit cultures, indexation and the whole quantification of knowledge production.},

Three major stages can, roughly, be detected. The first comes from a new Leftist background dealing with working class and youth culture, and the discussion of the notion 'ideology'. The second grew out of the youth culture debate in an attempt to re-politicize it, elaborated by the so-called 'German Pop left'. The third is now within academia, particularly in media studies and'Kulturwissenschaften'. The contribution aims to sketch out the limitations of the, however different, lines of the German reception of cultural studies as well as the weaknesses of the attempts to work in cultural studies with reference to what can be called the German (intellectual) tradition.},

  abstract = {The name Cultural Studies and its institutionalization in the university must not allow us to lose sight of the fact that reflection on culture is an old tradition, especially in a society like Peru's, so heterogeneous, conflictive and charged with history. The very fact of the convergence or clash of cultures in the sixteenth century fomented the consciousness that cultural uses and customs are not natural but must be understood in the light of history. Since the seventeenth century we have essays attempting to objectivize cultures and their (mis)understandings. These constitute a tradition of trying to imagine a viable society out of fragmentation. Garcilaso de la Vega and Huam{\'a}n Poma are the founders of this desire to comprehend the other and propose just ways of living together. In the nineteenth century this reflection deepens, since now the task is to constitute a nation. Many will think that homogenization around the creole identity is the path towards modernity. Others will feel that the past lives on and gives form to the present, necessarily complex and plural. This debate about the country takes place in literature and in cultural criticism, in the works of Mari{\'a}tegui, Arguedas, Vargas Llosa, Flores Galindo. This tradition is taken up by Cultural Studies which, as an academic activity is born of the dialogue between the humanities and the social sciences. It is a dialogue in which psychoanalysis functions to facilitate the encounter. This article emphasizes the immediate antecedents of the institutionalization of Cultural Studies and situates them within the framework of a necessary public intervention which characterizes this type of interdisciplinarity.},

  abstract = {This paper seeks to introduce cultural techniques to an Anglophone readership. Specifically geared towards an Anglophone readership, the paper relates the re-emergence of cultural techniques (a concept first employed in the 19th century in an agricultural context) to the changing intellectual constellation of postwar Germany. More specifically, it traces how the concept evolved from \textendash{} and reacted against \textendash{} so-called German media theory, a decidedly anti-hermeneutic and anti-humanist current of thought frequently associated with the work of Friedrich Kittler. Post-hermeneutic rather than anti-hermeneutic in its outlook, the reconceptualization of cultural techniques aims at presenting them as chains of operations that link humans, things, media and even animals. To investigate cultural techniques is to shift the analytic gaze from ontological distinctions to the ontic operations that gave rise to the former in the first place. As Siegert points out, this shift recalls certain concurrent developments within the North American posthumanities; the paper therefore also includes a discussion of the similarities and differences between German and North American posthumanism.},

Originally related to the agricultural domain, the notion of cultural techniques was later employed to describe the interactions between humans and media, and, most recently, to account for basic operations and differentiations that give rise to an array of conceptual and ontological entities which are said to constitute culture. In the second part of the essay, cultural techniques are analyzed as a concept that allows theorists to overcome certain biases and impasses characteristic of that domain of German media theory associated with the work of the late Friedrich Kittler.},

I argue that media sociology has been at its most vibrant when its goal has been to understand the dominant cultural structures that shape the public sphere. Robert Park was the first sociologist to adopt this perspective, with his research on newspapers and the power of the press. This interest continued into the 1950s, with research on media and propaganda. By the 1960s, however, concern had shifted away from the public character of media, focusing instead on the ways in which social factors intervened between media messages and society. While important, this shift in analytical focus ultimately led to a more reductionist media sociology, which failed to explore how media provided a distinctive type of social output. There is evidence that a less reductionist media sociology has begun to emerge since the 1990s, with the rise of cultural sociology and theories of the public sphere. This new media sociology could increase its visibility within mainstream sociology by making more explicit connections to the Chicago School tradition, and by claiming Robert Park as its classical founder.},

Mills's own published writings, along with those of his biographers, encourage a view of his time at the bureau as an aberration. Yet, a careful examination of his letters and his work reveals that the critical position for which Mills is famous was actually nourished by his use of surveys, statistics, research teams, and other trappings of administrative research while at the bureau.

The aim in generating a multiplicity of origins is not to suggest that the Birmingham origin is 'false' but to underscore the point that cultural studies has multiple origins rather than a singular origin; to provide concrete examples of those other origins that are too seldom suggested and almost never pinpointed; and, most importantly, to contribute to the evolution of a more international cultural studies as well as to keeping cultural studies in progressive, anti-disciplinary flux.},

As this article demonstrates, these assumptions continue to operate in the literature today. In updating the normative orientations that inform political communication research, the analysis focuses on certain research agendas as exemplar efforts of a changed philosophical position, called neoconservatism, which undergirds and structures studies critical of press performance. In particular, we critically examine 3 research programs in political communication that adhere to the field's formative intellectual assumptions as enduring critiques of media and democracy: the videomalaise hypothesis, media intrusion theory, and the social erosion thesis. Suggestions are made for a fuller integration of communication perspectives into political communication research as well as new ways of thinking about media in relation to politics.},

Although some successful and influential attempts of empirical and social research were made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, the tradition of regular research was not established before World War II. Until the late 1950s, empirical social sciences did not exist in the Soviet Union. Instead of research, society was described by using ideological construction of the Communist Party history. Attitudes toward sociology started to change in the middle of the 1960s. Empirical sociological research expanded into many areas of study and began to spread across the country. Sociology deserved official recognition and was very popular in society; sociologists enjoyed both official and popular prestige.

Drawing on the writings of Michel Foucualt and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as several Anglo-American cultural studies of disciplinarity, the essay argues that digital media studies has not yet constituted a truly novel scholarly discourse. Because of that, our reasons for disciplinizing?to the extent that it is possible to choose to become a discipline?would be largely strategic. Given that the field is already successfully reproducing itself, the symbolic benefits of becoming a discipline are relatively limited, and such a move would also have significant intellectual costs.},

It is implied that this young field is by now a discipline in its own right alongside such traditional disciplines as history, literature, sociology or political science. However, the nature of the discipline often remains unclear, while its identity is typically determined by administrative conven- ience and market demand rather than analysis of its historical development and scholarly position within the system of arts and sciences. This chapter discusses the nature and ter- minology of the discipline, with examples of Finland and other Nordic countries, and it advocates the need for a continuous self-assessment of the research community.},

How effective are such campaigns in changing health-related attitudes and behaviors, however, and how has the literature in this area progressed over the past decade? The purpose of the current article is threefold. First, I discuss the importance of health mass media campaigns and raise the question of whether they are capable of effectively impacting public health. Second, I review the literature and discuss what we have learned about the effectiveness of campaigns over the past 10 years. Finally, I conclude with a discussion of possible avenues for the health campaign literature over the next 10 years. The overriding conclusion is the following: The literature is beginning to amass evidence that targeted, well-executed health mass media campaigns can have small-to-moderate effects not only on health knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes, but on behaviors as well, which can translate into major public health impact given the wide reach of mass media. Such impact can only be achieved, however, if principles of effective campaign design are carefully followed.},

He began with the question of how film could be understood and studied as medium of communication, and from there, he moved on to larger and more profound questions about the nature of visual media in general and the role that visual images play in shaping and constructing reality. He is perhaps best known for the '' Navajo Film Project'' that he conducted with anthropologist John Adair in which they gave 16mm cameras to Navajo residents of the Pine Springs, Arizona reservation in order to explore how people who had never made or used movies would do so for the first time. How would their movies reflect their own culture and their ways of seeing and telling about their experiences? The book, Through Navajo Eyes, included here, became enormously influential in the fields of anthropology, communication and cinema studies, among others. In The Complete Sol Worth, editors Larry Gross and Jay Ruby collect all of Sol Worth's published writings, as well as some unpublished writings, extensive photo essays, and articles about Worth's work. Sol Worth's work remains relevant and influential in visual communication and anthropology, and the e-book format enables an accessible collection of the entirety of his contributions. Readers can also access Teaterri, a video documentary that Worth produced which is part of a permanent collection at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. We hope this collection will introduce new readers to Sol Worth's contribution to bettering our understanding of visual communication, culture, and life.One of the central figures in the development of the study of visual communication, Sol Worth (1922-1977) was a filmmaker and painter before he turned to academic pursuits.

He had always feared failure due to inadequate capital, and to make sure that this would not be the fate of the new Nielsen Company, he made careful estimates of the amount required and then raised three times that amount. He was aided by members of his fraternity, Sigma Phi, at the University of Wisconsin, who did not really understand the nature of the work the company proposed to undertake, but who had developed confidence in him because they had seen him working day and night to break the records for a scholarship in the College of Engineering\textendash{} records, incidentally, which have not yet been equaled. On asking Nielsen, about his unique contribution in the field he said that, there were several, and they did not all occur at the start. The first was the performance surveys. They were very useful to nearly every client who subscribed to this service. However, it was difficult to persuade the typical client to purchase a sufficient variety of these surveys to enable his salesmen to use them successfully with any type of prospect for his product and so that he could pile proof on proof to an extent which achieved conviction on the part of the prospect.},

He was born in Vienna, Austria and was interested in empirical research because he was trained as a mathematician and partly because empirical social research was of considerable political interest in that time of a rapidly rising Labor party in Austria. He states that in Austria, doing empirical research on the situation of the working class was of very great political importance because it clarified the importance of social stratification. In empirical research, he asserts that one has to distinguish between university organizations, university institutes and the increasing number of commercial research organizations. He claims that the structural elements of a good research bureau have two educational advantages. First, the relation between the project director and his assistant is much more intimate than between a graduate assistant and his graduate student. Second, it forces a much greater clarification of elements involved in research. He claims that there is a simple distinction between the department and the bureau. A full professor cannot tell an assistant professor or even an instructor what to do, that guarantees a famous academic freedom. In a bureau, the director hands to certain staff members certain tasks.},

His early '' sample surveys'' raised important methodological issues and recorded opinion results that reflect the vibrant times of war and policy making in a modernizing country. However, Radv{\'a}nyi's contribution to the profession has been virtually forgotten. Until now, accounts about how public opinion research began in Mexico either ignored Radv{\'a}nyi's works or reduced his ten years of survey research to a single footnote.

  abstract = {Scholars exploring the 'problem' of propaganda and democracy, or the history of propaganda and warfare, or the history of American mass communications research, consistently have marked World War I as the point at which the 'idea of propaganda' emerged in the modern era. Historians note that democratic governments had never relied so heavily on elaborate propaganda campaigns as part of their 'total war' ammunition; and never before, it seems, had the democratic citizenry been so manipulated. From the end of the World War I through World War II, a generation of American social critics, political theorists, and government officials were acutely aware that propaganda was ubiquitous, powerful, and a potentially highly destabilizing weapon of political warfare. My study explores the relationship between three important political and intellectual tendencies in mid-twentieth century America: Elite concerns about the rise of 'mass society' and its purported threat to democracy; the growth of American social sciences and the emergence of communications research as a response to the challenges of mass society; and the growth of centralized state power, particularly the state's expanding capacity for marginalizing and controlling political dissent. My dissertation is not a study of the production or dissemination of propaganda, or of different psychological warfare campaigns. Rather, I am concerned with fears about propaganda and how those fears shaped social critics' political assumptions, social scientists' analytical techniques, and government lawyers' frameworks for the purposes of mobilizing for war and creating and enforcing an administrative and prosecutory propaganda 'prophylaxis.' My research and analysis combines traditional concerns of political history with the strategies of intellectual history and the insights of the new cultural studies to explore the contradictions and tensions at the heart of twentieth-century liberal thought and action.},

  abstract = {The main memory of American mass communication research holds that scholars around Paul F. Lazarsfeld, in the years during and after World War II, dispelled the conventional wisdom that media marinate the defenseless American mind. According to the story, a loose and undisciplined body of pre-war thought had concluded naively that media are powerful\textemdash{}a myth punctured by the rigorous studies of Lazarsfeld and others, which showed time and again that media impact is in fact limited. This storyline, first narrated in Elihu Katz and Lazarsfeld's Personal Influence (1955), remains textbook boilerplate and literature review dogma fifty years later. The dissertation traces the emergence of this '' powerful-to-limited effects'' disciplinary legend, with special emphasis on the surprising contributions of sociologist Edward Shils, the mandarin theorist and intellectual maverick with little interest in the empirical study of media. In the crucial postwar years, Shils provided an account of the disappearance and reemergence of '' small group'' research, which he framed as a contrast between pictures of society\textemdash{}between the mistaken European view of impersonal isolation as against his view, that Gemeinschaft elements endure. Shils's treatment of small-group research, and especially his embedding of that story in terms of societal imagery, was essential to the field's mnemonic emplotment. Shils had his own intellectual reasons for narrating the history in the manner that he did\textemdash{}reasons rooted in his evolving and deeply engaged search for the underpinnings of modern social order. In a sense, however, his reasons did not matter once the narrative itself was released to the American sociological public; Lazarsfeld and Katz had their own reasons for adopting the historical picture that Shils put forward\textemdash{}reasons largely centered on scholarly competition and norms of originality. The powerful-to-limited-effects narrative in Personal Influence, in turn, was so widely embraced in the late 1950s for a still-different set of reasons\textemdash{}because of the scholarly support it lent to the public intellectual defense of American popular culture, in the context of an evolving Cold War liberalism. The staying power of this limited-effects narrative was ultimately guaranteed, however, by the newly institutionalized, would-be discipline of '' communication''\textemdash{}which retained the storyline as a usable, and teachable, past.},

  abstract = {The Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) was established by statute in 1972. This action built on a long history in this country of interest in examining the wider societal implications of science and technology. More specifically, it followed a decade of work by (what are now called) the Science Committee of the House of Representatives and the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate with the help of the private academic and industrial sectors, in particular the National Academy of Sciences. During the ensuing 23 years, under the guidance of an equally bipartisan congressional Board, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} evolved a structure and a process which provided analysis, information, and options to Congress and a reputation for nonpartisan, accurate and complete reporting. Importantly, \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} also provided, through the intense use as advisers of experts and stakeholders from the nongovernmental sector, an open interface between many American communities and Congress. The description of the justification, history, structure, and procedures of \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} affords a perspective on the abrupt abolishment of the agency in the first session of the 104th Congress. A number of explanatory factors rather than a single one were likely responsible for OTA's elimination and are noted. The implications of abolishing \textbackslash{\O}TA\textbackslash{} are also discussed.},

By mid-century, mass communications researchers had become recognized as experts in describing the effects of the mass media on learning and other social behavior. However, the conditions that promoted and sustained their authority as experts have not been adequately explored. This study analyzes the ideological and historical forces giving rise to, and shaping, their research."\textendash{}BOOK JACKET.},

  abstract = {In The Citizen Audience, Richard Butsch explores the cultural and political history of audiences in the United States from the nineteenth century to the present. He demonstrates that, while attitudes toward audiences have shifted over time, Americans have always judged audiences against standards of good citizenship. From descriptions of tightly packed crowds in early American theaters to the contemporary reports of distant, anonymous Internet audiences, Butsch examines how audiences were represented in contemporary discourse. He explores a broad range of sources on theater, movies, propaganda, advertising, broadcast journalism, and much more. Butsch discovers that audiences were characterized according to three recurrent motifs: as crowds and as isolated individuals in a mass, both of which were considered bad, and as publics which were considered ideal audiences. These images were based on and reinforced class and other social hierarchies. At times though, subordinate groups challenged their negative characterization in these images, and countered with their own interpretations. A remarkable work of cultural criticism and media history, this book is essential reading for anyone seeking an historical understanding of how audiences, media and entertainment function in the American cultural and political imagination.},

Specifically, the discussion groups disciplinary histories into 2 different kinds of narratives, referred to as biographical and intellectual histories. The first group has as its method biography, and focuses on the achievement of central individuals and the methodology of their research. It is argued that these accounts constitute rituals of disciplinary affirmation. The second group has as its method intellectual history, and focuses on the theoretical foundations of ideas taken up by communication scholars, tracing the relations among ideology, culture, technology, and communication. These accounts, on the other hand, are read as polite rebellions against received understandings of communication history.},

This introductory essay illustrates the needs for such a volume to fill an important gap in IC history, provides a rationale for focusing on the 1970s, and discusses the current state of documenting various expressions of the intercultural discipline. It highlights the value of biography as one historical window from which to review or reconstruct the social history derived from the interdisciplinary influences and outcomes of IC or related intercultural fields. After a brief review of earlier people and tracks that influenced the field's eventual formation, it provides categorical and chronological summaries of people and their initiatives in and around the 1970s that established IC, the rationale that guided inclusions or omissions for this '' selected'' set of biographies, and highlights other worthy influencers not profiled. This essay provides an overview for the questions that contributing authors were asked to address about each person featured in this special issue: (1) the ways they founded, influenced, or affected the ongoing IC field or related intercultural work, (2) the topics or domains that they influenced, (3) the lines or types of IC they launched and outcomes of their legacies, and (4) the principles, practices, or personal characteristics those in the field now can reconsider as catalysts for renewal or future developments.},

  abstract = {Coined in the 1920s as a way to describe radio, motion pictures, wide-circulation magazines, and the press, the term "mass communication" frequently is misused in the era of cable TV, niche marketing, and the Internet. In Refiguring Mass Communication, Peter Simonson compares his own vision of mass communication with distinct views articulated throughout history by Paul of Tarsus, Walt Whitman, Charles Horton Cooley, David Sarnoff, and Robert K. Merton, utilizing a collection of texts and tenets from a variety of time periods and perspectives. Drawing on textual and archival research as well as access to Merton's personal papers, Simonson broadly reconceives a sense of communication theory and what social processes might be considered species of mass communication. Simonson reveals the geographical and social contexts from which these visions have emerged and the religious and moral horizons against which they have taken shape. In a unique perspective, he considers the American county fair as an example of a live gathering and crucial site that is overlooked in contemporary forms of mass communication, urging a reconsideration of how individuals participate in and shape similar forms.},

The paper presents his thoughts on the past 10 years of marketing scholarship, his views on future directions and some advice for those looking to publish their research in academic journals. Design/methodology/approach The paper takes a reflective, discursive approach, and also reviews a wide range of topics relevant to marketing researchers. Findings The author finds that EJM has grown substantially on many levels in the past decade. He also finds that there are some concerns around marketing research, and social scientific scholarship in general, that marketing scholars may wish to consider and take into account in their ongoing work. Research limitations/implications The paper is partly a personal view, and does not rely on any empirical research. However, the views espoused are justified by theoretical review and conceptual argument. Practical implications The implications of this paper are relevant to marketing scholars, journal reviewers, readers of research, as well as those who manage scholarship (e.g. university administrators). The author suggests a number of directions that the research, publication and reward process could move in to improve practice. Originality/value The paper brings together a large number of different views and concepts relevant to further development of marketing research, and provides original summaries and extensions.},

An important new development in cultural studies in Japan is Cultural Typhoon. This new movement seeks to avoid institutionalization and create an alternative academic public sphere alongside broadened cultural practices, social activities and political interventions. Cultural studies in Japan can be seen as a part of a new diversity in cultural studies, which has some potentialities to move beyond the academy and open new dialogical spaces for communication and cultural intervention.},

Drawing on a variety of archival materials for evidence of the commission's thinking, this essay argues that the concept of accountability was originally intended as a guide to policy making and that, to appreciate the continuing relevance of the commission's work as a landmark in media studies, it is essential to understand the policy orientation that underlay most of its ideas and recommendations.},

While The 'Nationwide' Audience has been acclaimed as one of the most influential empirical works in audience studies, it has been often misunderstood as if the work failed to find out systemic and consistent influences of viewers' social conditions on decoding practices. On the contrary, by using a statistical method, this paper demonstrates that the audiences' decodings of the programme presented by Morley are in fact clearly patterned by their social positions. The findings reveal the over-determined effects of various social conditions such as class, gender, race and age. Particularly, the results seem to restore the importance of social class on the interpretive process, which has been displaced and ignored in many current media studies. Highlighting audiences' structural social positions, the reading patterns rediscovered here allow us to rebut not only the traditional Marxist view of class determinism but also any relativist accounts of cultural activity.},

@article{stabile_resistance_1995,
  abstract = {Since the early 1980s, the paradigm of resistance (which emerges from a particular reading of Antonio Gramsci's theory of hegemony) has enjoyed widespread popularity in the field of media studies. Arguing for understanding media studies as a field, in Pierre Bourdieu 's sense of the term, this article explores the analytical and political limits of this paradigm and, by extension, the intellectual vision that proceeds from it. The author focuses specifically on the problems that proceed from this textualist model by examining its internal limitations and the questions and lines of critical analysis it forecloses. Against this model, the author argues that Pierre Bourdieu 's sociological theory offers a necessary corrective to the lack of self-reflexivity and critical insight that has resulted from the domidnance of this paradigm within media studies.},

  abstract = {Raymond Williams had an enduring interest in science fiction, an interest attested to: first, by two articles specifically addressed to the genre, both of which were eventually published in the journal Science Fiction Studies; second, by a wide range of reference in more familiar texts, such as Culture and Society, The Long Revolution, George Orwell and The Country and the City; and third, by his two 'future novels', The Volunteers and The Fight for Manod, the first clearly science-fictional in character, the latter less so. This article will summarise this work, and will also explore how some of Williams's more general key theoretical concepts \textendash{} especially structure of feeling and selective tradition \textendash{} can be applied to the genre. Finally, it will argue that the 'sociological' turn, by which Williams sought to substitute description and explanation for judgement and canonisation as the central purposes of analysis, represents a more productive approach to science fiction studies than the kind of prescriptive criticism deployed by other avowedly 'neo-Marxist' works, such as Darko Suvin's Metamorphoses of Science Fiction and Fredric Jameson's Archaeologies of the Future.},

  abstract = {Raymond Williams and I arrived in Cambridge simultaneously in 1961, he from a long stint in adult education to a college Fellowship, I from a year's teaching in a Northern secondary modern school to an undergraduate place. It was hard to say which of us was more alienated. Williams had made the long trek from a rural working-class community in Wales to a college which seemed to judge people (as I was to find out later to my cost) by how often they dined at High Table. He looked and spoke more like a countryman than a don, and had a warmth and simplicity of manner which contrasted sharply with the suave, off-hand style of the upper middle class establishment. He never got used to the casual malice of the Senior Combination Room, and was to write years later, in a fine obituary of F.R. Leavis, that Cambridge was 'one of the rudest places on earth . . . shot through with cold, nasty and bloody-minded talk'. I found myself marooned within a student body where everyone seemed to be well over six foot, brayed rather than spoke, stamped their feet in cinemas at the feeblest joke and addressed each other like public meetings in intimate cafes. It was a toss-up which of us was going to make it.},

  abstract = {In 1938, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch convened a symposium on the freedom of the press in response to a letter from President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The President hoped to have a 'national symposium' to discuss whether a free press could truly exist in a for-profit media system. The Symposium on the Freedom of the Press brought together 120 public intellectuals to discuss the matter. Here, I attempt to reacquaint scholars with this forgotten collection of contributions on the subject. I specifically focus my analysis on two major themes: the way contributors define public interest and their response to Roosevelt's question as to whether a newspaper could only be edited in the interests of the 'counting room,' as he put it.},

It offers a new understanding of the role Lippmann played in yoking together a range of communication-related issues under a single problematic. In the process it exposes a critical lacunae stretching across (and beyond) scholarship in communications research: a lack of attention to the rhetorical deployment of Lippmann, characterized by an inclination to endow this figure's political philosophy with the power to stand in for a range of developments occurring across an emerging communications field. This essay addresses the implications of being positioned to speak not only for a field of research but for history as well, being able to so perfectly mirror shifts in cultural attitudes and emerging institutional practices.},
